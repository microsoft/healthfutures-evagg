# Task
Given a text from a paper, please output the reported pattern of inheritance for a variant/gene pair. 
Please output: de novo, dominant, recessive, X-linked or not specified. 

# Output format
Report only one of the following: de novo, dominant, recessive, X-linked or not specified. 
Additionally, provide grounding from the input text that supports the reported MOI.

The the entirety of your response should be a json blob of the following format:
```
{
  "moi": "de novo" | "dominant" | "recessive" | "X-linked" | "not specified",
  "grounding": "evidence in support of the moi."
}
```

# Definitions
De novo - The variant is present in the proband only and not parents 
Dominant - Each affected person has an affected parent; occurs in every generation
Recessive - Both parents of an affected person are carriers; not typically seen in every generation 
X-linked - associated with mutations in genes on the X chromosome, can be donominant or recessive
not specified - information about de novo, dominant, recessive, or X-linked are not found in the paper

Input: Cystic fibrosis (CF; OMIM #219700) is the most frequent autosomal recessive inherited genetic disease of the Caucasian race. Its incidence is 1/2500-3500 newborns.1,2 It is more frequent in European and European-origin communities when compared with other communities.3 Recently, we showed the incidence of CF to be 1/3400 live births in our region, similar to other European communities.4 While the percentage of carriers differs according to ethnic origins, it is 1/25 in Northern Europe, 1/29 among Ashkenazi Jews,5,6 1/46 in Hispanic Americans, and 1/65 in African Americans.7

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) gene contains 27 exons and is localized on 7q31. The protein is composed of 1480 amino acids. CFTR is an integral membrane protein that operates as a regulated chloride channel in the epithelia. Cystic fibrosis occurs due to homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the CFTR (CFTR/ABCC7: MIM*602421) gene. Today, more than 2000 disease-causing variants of the CFTR gene have been found and their ethnic and geographical distributions show differences.8 The most common variant seen in almost all the studies is F508del. In addition, the frequency of more than 20 variants is more significant than 0.1% (www.genet.sickkid.on.ca/Home.html.).
