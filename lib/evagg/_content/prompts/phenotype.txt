#Task:
Given this text from a paper: {{$passage}},

please output (using format below) the reported phenotype for this patient: {{$patient}} based on this gene {{$gene}} variant: {{$variant}}. 

Please strictly use the following format for all output:

#Output format:
Provide your response in the following format:
{
  "phenotype": [
    "first phenotypic description",
    "second phenotypic description",
    "etc"
  ]
}

If you cannot determine the phenotype from the text provided please respond:
{
  "phenotype": [
    "unknown"
  ]
}

#Definitions for potentially ambiguous terms:
unknown: information about the patient phenotype is not found in the text
