#Task:
Given this text from a paper: {{$passage}},

please output (using format below) the reported variant inheritance for this patient: {{$patient}} based on this gene {{$gene}} variant: {{$variant}}. 

Output maternally inherited, paternally inherited, de novo, ?de novo (not confirmed), or unknown. Please strictly use the following format for all output:

#Output format:
{
  "grounding": "evidence in support of the zygosity.",
  "variant_inheritance": "maternally inherited" | "paternally inherited" | "de novo" | "?de novo (not confirmed)" | "or unknown"
}

#Definitions for potentially ambiguous terms:
unknown: information about maternally inherited, paternally inherited, de novo, ?de novo (not confirmed) is not found in the text
?de novo (not confirmed): de novo variant inheritance yet not confirmed in text
