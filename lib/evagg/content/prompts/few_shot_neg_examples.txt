Title: All three MutL complexes are required for repeat expansion in a human stem cell model of CAG-repeat expansion mediated glutaminase deficiency.
Abstract: The Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) arise from expansion of a disease-specific short tandem repeat (STR). Different REDs differ with respect to the repeat involved, the cells that are most expansion prone and the extent of expansion and whether these diseases share a common expansion mechanism is unclear. To date, expansion has only been studied in a limited number of REDs. Here we report the first studies of the expansion mechanism in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with a form of the glutaminase deficiency disorder known as Global Developmental Delay, Progressive Ataxia, And Elevated Glutamine (GDPAG; OMIM# 618412) caused by the expansion of a CAG-STR in the 5' UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. We show that alleles with as few as ~100 repeats show detectable expansions in culture despite relatively low levels of R-looped formed at this locus. Additionally, using a CRISPR-cas9 knockout approach we show that PMS2 and MLH3, the constituents of MutLα and MutLγ, the 2 mammalian MutL complexes known to be involved in mismatch repair (MMR), are essential for expansion. Furthermore, PMS1, a component of a less well understood MutL complex, MutLβ, is also important, if not essential, for repeat expansion in these cells. Our results provide insights into the factors important for expansion and lend weight to the idea that, despite some differences, many, if not all, REDs likely expand via in very similar ways.

Title: Establishment, characterization and functional testing of two novel ex vivo extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) cell models.
Abstract: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm of uncertain differentiation as classified by the WHO Classification of Tumours 2020. Although often associated with pronlonged survival, EMC has high rates of distant recurrences and disease-associated death. EMCs are translocation sarcomas and harbor in > 90% of the cases an NR4A3 rearrangement. The molecular consequences of the NR4A3 gene fusions are not yet fully elucidated as well-characterized ex vivo cell models for EMC are lacking. Patient-derived ex vivo models are important and essential tools for investigating disease mechanisms associated with diseases that are rare, that exhibit poor prognosis and for the identification of potential novel treatment options. We established two novel EMC ex vivo models (USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2) for functional testing and research purposes. USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2 were established and maintained as sarco-sphere cell models for several months in culture. The cells were molecularly characterized using DNA sequencing and methylation profiling. Both cell models represent their native tumor tissue as confirmed by histomorphology and their molecular profiles, suggesting that native tumor cell function can be recapitulated in the ex vivo models. Using a functional screening approach, novel anti-cancer drug sensitivities including potential synergistic combinations were identified. In conclusion, two novel EMC ex vivo cell models (USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2) were successfully established and characterized from native tumor tissues. Both cell models will be useful tools for further investigating disease mechanisms and for answering basic and translational research questions.

Title: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a case-only analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations.
Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare soft tissue sarcomas that typically develop from mesenchymal cells with acquired gain-in-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA oncogenes. These somatic mutations have been well-characterized, but little is known about inherited genetic risk factors. Given evidence that certain susceptibility loci and carcinogens are associated with characteristic mutations in other cancers, we hypothesized that these signature KIT or PDGFRA mutations may be similarly fundamental to understanding gastrointestinal stromal tumor etiology. Therefore, we examined associations between 522 single nucleotide polymorphisms and seven KIT or PDGFRA tumor mutations types. Candidate pathways included dioxin response, toxin metabolism, matrix metalloproteinase production, and immune and inflammatory response. We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between each candidate SNP and tumor mutation type in 279 individuals from a clinical trial of adjuvant imatinib mesylate. We used sequence kernel association tests to look for pathway-level associations. One variant, rs1716 on ITGAE, was significantly associated with KIT exon 11 non-codon 557-8 deletions (odds ratio = 2.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.71-4.78) after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Other noteworthy associations included rs3024498 (IL10) and rs1050783 (F13A1) with PDGFRA mutations, rs2071888 (TAPBP) with wild type tumors and several matrix metalloproteinase SNPs with KIT exon 11 codon 557-558 deletions. Several pathways were strongly associated with somatic mutations in PDGFRA, including defense response (p = 0.005) and negative regulation of immune response (p = 0.01). This exploratory analysis offers novel insights into gastrointestinal stromal tumor etiology and provides a starting point for future studies of genetic and environmental risk factors for the disease.

Title: Troponin Variants in Congenital Myopathies: How They Affect Skeletal Muscle Mechanics.
Abstract: The troponin complex is a key regulator of muscle contraction. Multiple variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes result in congenital myopathies. TNNC2 has been implicated in a novel congenital myopathy, TNNI2 and TNNT3 in distal arthrogryposis (DA), and TNNT1 and TNNT3 in nemaline myopathy (NEM). Variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes compromise sarcomere function, e.g., by altering the Ca2+ sensitivity of force or by inducing atrophy. Several potential therapeutic strategies are available to counter the effects of variants, such as troponin activators, introduction of wild-type protein through AAV gene therapy, and myosin modulation to improve muscle contraction. The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological effects of the variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes are incompletely understood. Furthermore, limited knowledge is available on the structure of skeletal troponin. This review focusses on the physiology of slow and fast skeletal troponin and the pathophysiology of reported variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes. A better understanding of the pathophysiological effects of these variants, together with enhanced knowledge regarding the structure of slow and fast skeletal troponin, will direct the development of treatment strategies.
