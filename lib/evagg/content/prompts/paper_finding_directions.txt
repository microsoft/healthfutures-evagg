Gene: FBN2, PMID: 31316167
Title: A clinical scoring system for congenital contractural arachnodactyly.
Abstract: Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder manifesting joint contractures, arachnodactyly, crumpled ears, and kyphoscoliosis as main features. Due to its rarity, rather aspecific clinical presentation, and overlap with other conditions including Marfan syndrome, the diagnosis is challenging, but important for prognosis and clinical management. CCA is caused by pathogenic variants in FBN2, encoding fibrillin-2, but locus heterogeneity has been suggested. We designed a clinical scoring system and diagnostic criteria to support the diagnostic process and guide molecular genetic testing.

Gene: COG4, PMID: 19494034
Title: Golgi function and dysfunction in the first COG4-deficient CDG type II patient.
Abstract: The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is a hetero-octameric complex essential for normal glycosylation and intra-Golgi transport. An increasing number of congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II) mutations are found in COG subunits indicating its importance in glycosylation. We report a new CDG-II patient harbouring a p.R729W missense mutation in COG4 combined with a submicroscopical deletion. The resulting downregulation of COG4 expression additionally affects expression or stability of other lobe A subunits. Despite this, full complex formation was maintained albeit to a lower extent as shown by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Moreover, our data indicate that subunits are present in a cytosolic pool and full complex formation assists tethering preceding membrane fusion. By extending this study to four other known COG-deficient patients, we now present the first comparative analysis on defects in transport, glycosylation and Golgi ultrastructure in these patients. The observed structural and biochemical abnormalities correlate with the severity of the mutation, with the COG4 mutant being the mildest. All together our results indicate that intact COG complexes are required to maintain Golgi dynamics and its associated functions. According to the current CDG nomenclature, this newly identified deficiency is designated CDG-IIj.

Gene: DNAJC7, PMID: 33193563
Title: A Novel Potentially Pathogenic Rare Variant in the DNAJC7 Gene Identified in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients From Mainland China.
Abstract: Variants in the DNAJC7 gene have been shown to be novel causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the contributions of DNAJC7 mutations in Asian ALS patients remain unclear. In this study, we screened rare pathogenic variants in the DNAJC7 gene in a cohort of 578 ALS patients from Mainland China. A novel, rare, putative pathogenic variant c.712A>G (p.R238G) was identified in one sporadic ALS patient. The carrier with this variant exhibited symptom onset at a relatively younger age and experienced rapid disease progression. Our results expand the pathogenic variant spectrum of DNAJC7 and indicate that variants in the DNAJC7 gene may also contribute to ALS in the Chinese population.

Gene: MLH3, PMID: 15193445
Title: No association between two MLH3 variants (S845G and P844L)and colorectal cancer risk.
Abstract: Recently we identified a new variant, S845G, in the MLH3 gene in 7 out of 327 patients suspected of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer but not fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria and in 1 out of 188 control subjects. As this variant might play a role in causing sporadic colorectal cancer, we analyzed its prevalence in sporadic colorectal cancer patients. We analyzed a small part of exon 1 of the MLH3 gene, including the S845G variant, in germline DNA of 467 white sporadic colorectal cancer patients and 497 white controls. The S845G variant was detected in five patients and eight controls; the results thus indicate that this variant does not confer an increased colorectal cancer risk. Another variant (P844L) was clearly a polymorphism. Three other missense variants were rare and the sample size of the study was too small to conclude whether they are pathogenic. In conclusion, no association was observed between two MLH3 variants (P844L and S845G) and colorectal cancer risk.
