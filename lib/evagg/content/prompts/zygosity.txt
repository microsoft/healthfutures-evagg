Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants in the gene {{$gene}}.

I would like you to determine the zygosity for the patient and variant described below. By zygosity I mean
the number of copies of this particular variant that the patient described below possesses. Multiple patients
in the paper might possess this variant, but I want you to determine the zygosity for this patient specifically.

The patient of interest may be referred to by any of the following identifiers: {{$patient_descriptions}}. The genetic
variant possessed by this patient for which I want you to determine the zygosity may be described in any of
the following ways: {{$variant_descriptions}}.

It is possible that the zygosity for this patient and variant isn't described in the text, if that is the case, provide 
"none" as your response value. This is most often the case in review papers that are summarizing information on a large 
number of different variants.

Occasionally zygosity is also referred to as the mode of inheritance for a particular patient (not to be confused with
the mode of inheritance for a disease). When observing the mode of inheritance for a particular patient, de novo and 
autosomal dominant can generally be used to infer heterozygous zygosity, and autosomal recessive can generally be used
to infer homozygous zygosity.

Compound heterozygous zygosity refers to cases where an individual patient possesses two different variants, often in
the same gene.

The options for zygosity available for you to choose from are: "homozygous", "heterozygous", 
"compound heterozygous", and "none". Choose only one of these options in your response. Do not choose any other values 
for your response.

Provide your response as a valid JSON object, using the following format.
{
  "zygosity": "homozygous" | "heterozygous" | "compound heterozygous" | "none"
}
