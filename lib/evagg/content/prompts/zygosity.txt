Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants in the gene {{$gene}}.

I would like you to determine the zygosity for the patient and variant described below. Multiple patients
in the paper might possess this variant, but I want you to determine the zygosity for this patient specifically.
The patient of interest may be referred to by any of the following identifiers: {{$patient_descriptions}}. The genetic
variant possessed by this patient for which I want you to determine the zygosity may be described in any of
the following ways: {{$variant_descriptions}}.

The options for zygosity available for you to choose from are: "homozygous", "heterozygous", 
"compound heterozygous", and "none". Choose only one of these options in your response.

-- Output format --

Provide your response as a valid JSON object, using the following format.
{
  "zygosity": "homozygous" | "heterozygous" | "compound heterozygous" | "none"
}
