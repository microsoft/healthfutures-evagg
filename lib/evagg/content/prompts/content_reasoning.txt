Below is the text for an academic research paper about rare disease. Your task is to identify accounts of genetic 
variation in the gene {{$gene}} by reading the paper. An individual account of genetic variation is indexed both by the 
variant as well as the individual who possessed it (if specified). We'll call this an "observation." 

For each observation, first identify the genetic variant and individual who possesed it. It is 
possible that a single variant is described in multiple ways in the text, when it is correct to do so, consolidate 
biologically equivalent variants (e.g., when both the coding variant and the corresponding protein variant are provided 
in the text). Provide me with a comma-separated list of the descriptions of the variant used in the text ("paper_variant") as well as the
normalized HGVS descriptions of (a) the DNA variant ("hgvs_c") expressed in either c. notation for coding/splice variants and g. 
notation for deep intronic or intergenic variants and (b) the associated protein consequence ("hgvs_p"), if applicable.
If papers provide only the coding variant, the resultant consequence should be inferred if possible. If papers provide 
only the protein consequence it is generally impossible to infer the specific causal variant and this should be left blank.
If papers provide detail on the specific transcript that was affected/studied, provide this in the "transcript" output
field. If not, provide the MANE select transcript for {{$gene}} instead.

Once the variant and individual have been identified, I also want you to identify the variant type, zygosity, mode of 
inheritance, and observed patient phenotype. 

This paper may discuss variants in other genes, but we're only interested in variants in the gene 
{{$gene}}.

More detail on each of the output fields is provided below. 

Here is a description of the output fields for each observation.
paper_variant - a comma separated list of the descriptions of the found in the text
hgvs_c - the DNA variant in valid hgvs.c or hgvs.g nomenclature format
hgvs_p - the consequential protein variant in valid hgvs.p nomenclature format
transcript - the associated transcript for coding variants
individual_id - an identifier for the individual possessing the variant if one is provided, otherwise "unknown" if not 
    provided
variant_type - single value chosen from missense, frameshift, stop gained, splice donor, splice acceptor, splice region,
    start lost, inframe deletion, frameshift deletion, inframe insertion, frameshift insertion, structural, synonymous,
    intron, 5' UTR, 3' UTR, non-coding, unknown
zygosity - single value chosen from homozygous, heterozygous, compound heterozygous, unknown
variant_inheritance - single value chosen from inherited, de novo, unknown
phenotype - list of values chosen from the Human Phenotype ontology, each value should include the description and HPO
    identifier (e.g., "Arachnodactyly (HP:0001166)")

Your output format should be a JSON object with a single top level field called "observations" that contains a list 
of observations, with each observation being an object that contains a field for "paper_variant", "hgvs_c", "hgvs_p", 
"transcript", "individual_id", "variant_type", "zygosity", "variant_inheritance", and "phenotype".

An example output might look like:

{
    "observations": [
        {
            "paper_variant": "p.Cys795Tyr, c.2384G>A",
            "hgvs_c": "c.2384G>A",
            "hgvs_p": "p.Cys795Tyr",
            "transcript": "NM_001999.4",
            "individual_id": "unknown",
            "variant_type": "missense",
            "zygosity": "heterozygous",
            "variant_inheritance": "inherited",
            "phenotype": "Camptodactyly (HP:0012385); Contractures of the large joints (HP:0005781); Arachnodactyly (HP:0001166)"
        }
    ]
}
