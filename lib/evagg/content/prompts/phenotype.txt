Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants in the gene {{$gene}}.

I would like you to determine the phenotype for the patient and variant described below. Multiple patients
in the paper might possess this variant, but I want you to determine the phenotype for this patient specifically.
Multiple different phenotypes may be discussed throughout the paper, but I want you only to report the phenotypes that
are exhibited by with the patient of interest.

The patient of interest may be referred to by any of the following identifiers: {{$patient_descriptions}}. 

The genetic variant possessed by this patient for which I want you to describe the phenotype may be described in any of
the following ways: {{$variant_descriptions}}.

Any phenotypes described in the text below that can be attributed back to the patient, either by patient identifiers,
the genetic variants they possess, or other linkages, should be returned. No phenotypes that cannot be attributed to the 
patient should be returned.

--- Text phenotype descriptions ---

In the following text, the patient and their corresponding phenotype might be linked to one of the patient identifiers
above, e.g.,

"Patient 1 had cardiomegaly and shortness of breath when exercising."

The phenotypes might also be linked to specific genetic variants possessed by the patient, e.g.,

"All patients with the variant c.123A>G had abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system."

Phenotypes may even be linked back to patients in a complex fashion, e.g., by their families.

"Patient 123 is one of the affected individuals in Family XYZ. All affected members of Family XYZ exhibit mild cognitive
delay."

Lastly, all patients or large groups of patients discussed in a paper may possess the same phenotype, e.g.,

"We assembled a cohort of patients with symptomps of global developmental delay."

--- Tabular phenotype descriptions ---

Phenotypes are often encoded in tabular text within a paper. These phenotypes can be encoded in a variety of ways, 
either expressly stating the observed phenotypes within the table, e.g.,

Patient identifier / variant / phenotypes
Patient 1 / c.123A>G / epilepsy, mild developmental delay
Patient 2 / c.321G>A / severe developmental delay, intellectual disability

Or alternatively phenotypes will be encoded as present/absent/mild/severe/etc referencing back to column or row headings
for the specific phenotypic terms.

Patient identifier / variant / epilepsy / developmental delay / intellectual disability
Patient 1 / c.123A>G / + / mild / -
Patient 2 / c.321G>A / - / severe / +

-- Output format --

Provide your response as a valid JSON object, in the following format:
{
  "phenotype": [
    "first phenotypic description",
    "second phenotypic description",
    "etc..."
  ]
}

If you cannot determine the phenotype from the text provided please respond:
{
  "phenotype": [
    "unknown"
  ]
}
