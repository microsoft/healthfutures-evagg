Above you will find some text from a paper describing genetic variants in the gene {{$gene}}.
I want you to tell me variant type for the genetic variant described in any of the following 
ways: {{$variant_descriptions}}.

Often the variant type can be determined from the description alone, or the description can be used to help narrow
the set of possible types for a given variant.

Here are some examples of this in action:
- For simple variants with a single base pair substitution, e.g., c.274G>T, the variant type is generally
  always synonymous, missense, or stop-gained. This can be determined by looking at the protein consequence for the 
  variant. In the case of the variant from earlier in this paragraph, the protein consequence is p.Asp92Tyr. Because
  we're substituting one amino acid (Tyrosine) for a different one (Aspartic Acid), this is a missense mutation. If
  instead the base pair substitution resulted in no change in amino acid, the protein consequence would be represented
  as p.Asp92= and the variant type would be synonymous. Finally, if the base pair subsitution resulted in a stop codon,
  this would be represented as p.Asp92*, p.Asp92Ter, or p.D92X and the variant type would be stop gained. Any p. variant 
  descriptions that end in "*", "Ter", or "X" are stop gained variants.
- Typically, frameshift variants involve insertion or deletion of base pairs (referred to as frameshift insertion and 
  frameshift deletion, respectively). They include the text "fs" in the description of the protein consequence. 
  Examples of this might be c.274_275del, which is a variant with two deleted base pairs and the corresponding protein 
  consequence p.Asp92Leufs*21. Or alternatively c.274_275insT and c.274dup are both single base pair insertions that
  both result in frameshifts in protein consequence, p.Asp92Glyfs*22 and p.Asp92Valfs*22 respectively.
- Note that not all insertions or deletions are frameshifts. An insertion that adds a multiple of 3 bases, or a deletion
  that removes a multiple of 3 bases are referred to as an inframe insertion or inframe deletion, respectively. An 
  example of an inframe insertion is c.350_351insGGG (protein consequence p.Gly117dup) and an inframe deletion is 
  c.350_352del (protein consequence p.Gly117del).
- Splice donor, splice acceptor, splice region, intronic, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, and non-coding variants are a little bit 
  trickier, and it might be necessary to derive additional context from the main text of the paper. Very often the
  descriptions of these variants might include a "+" or "-" symbol, e.g., c.490+2T>G. Alternatively, they might be 
  described using a chromosomal reference sequence, e.g., g.112088970del - this is challenging to disambiguate from any 
  other variant type by variant description alone, and the source text must be read for interpretation.
- Structural variants typically involve hundreds to tens of thousands of base pairs and are often described quite
  differently in the text.
