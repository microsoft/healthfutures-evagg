Gene: FBN2, PMID: 31316167
Title: A clinical scoring system for congenital contractural arachnodactyly.
Abstract: Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder manifesting joint contractures, arachnodactyly, crumpled ears, and kyphoscoliosis as main features. Due to its rarity, rather aspecific clinical presentation, and overlap with other conditions including Marfan syndrome, the diagnosis is challenging, but important for prognosis and clinical management. CCA is caused by pathogenic variants in FBN2, encoding fibrillin-2, but locus heterogeneity has been suggested. We designed a clinical scoring system and diagnostic criteria to support the diagnostic process and guide molecular genetic testing.

Gene: COG4, PMID: 19494034
Title: Golgi function and dysfunction in the first COG4-deficient CDG type II patient.
Abstract: The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is a hetero-octameric complex essential for normal glycosylation and intra-Golgi transport. An increasing number of congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG-II) mutations are found in COG subunits indicating its importance in glycosylation. We report a new CDG-II patient harbouring a p.R729W missense mutation in COG4 combined with a submicroscopical deletion. The resulting downregulation of COG4 expression additionally affects expression or stability of other lobe A subunits. Despite this, full complex formation was maintained albeit to a lower extent as shown by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Moreover, our data indicate that subunits are present in a cytosolic pool and full complex formation assists tethering preceding membrane fusion. By extending this study to four other known COG-deficient patients, we now present the first comparative analysis on defects in transport, glycosylation and Golgi ultrastructure in these patients. The observed structural and biochemical abnormalities correlate with the severity of the mutation, with the COG4 mutant being the mildest. All together our results indicate that intact COG complexes are required to maintain Golgi dynamics and its associated functions. According to the current CDG nomenclature, this newly identified deficiency is designated CDG-IIj.

Title: A Novel Potentially Pathogenic Rare Variant in the DNAJC7 Gene Identified in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients From Mainland China.
Abstract: Variants in the DNAJC7 gene have been shown to be novel causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the contributions of DNAJC7 mutations in Asian ALS patients remain unclear. In this study, we screened rare pathogenic variants in the DNAJC7 gene in a cohort of 578 ALS patients from Mainland China. A novel, rare, putative pathogenic variant c.712A>G (p.R238G) was identified in one sporadic ALS patient. The carrier with this variant exhibited symptom onset at a relatively younger age and experienced rapid disease progression. Our results expand the pathogenic variant spectrum of DNAJC7 and indicate that variants in the DNAJC7 gene may also contribute to ALS in the Chinese population.

Title: No association between two MLH3 variants (S845G and P844L)and colorectal cancer risk.
Abstract: Recently we identified a new variant, S845G, in the MLH3 gene in 7 out of 327 patients suspected of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer but not fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria and in 1 out of 188 control subjects. As this variant might play a role in causing sporadic colorectal cancer, we analyzed its prevalence in sporadic colorectal cancer patients. We analyzed a small part of exon 1 of the MLH3 gene, including the S845G variant, in germline DNA of 467 white sporadic colorectal cancer patients and 497 white controls. The S845G variant was detected in five patients and eight controls; the results thus indicate that this variant does not confer an increased colorectal cancer risk. Another variant (P844L) was clearly a polymorphism. Three other missense variants were rare and the sample size of the study was too small to conclude whether they are pathogenic. In conclusion, no association was observed between two MLH3 variants (P844L and S845G) and colorectal cancer risk.

Title: Mammalian BLM helicase is critical for integrating multiple pathways of meiotic recombination.
Abstract: Bloom's syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth retardation, cancer predisposition, and sterility. BS mutated (Blm), the gene mutated in BS patients, is one of five mammalian RecQ helicases. Although BLM has been shown to promote genome stability by assisting in the repair of DNA structures that arise during homologous recombination in somatic cells, less is known about its role in meiotic recombination primarily because of the embryonic lethality associated with Blm deletion. However, the localization of BLM protein on meiotic chromosomes together with evidence from yeast and other organisms implicates a role for BLM helicase in meiotic recombination events, prompting us to explore the meiotic phenotype of mice bearing a conditional mutant allele of Blm. In this study, we show that BLM deficiency does not affect entry into prophase I but causes severe defects in meiotic progression. This is exemplified by improper pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes and altered processing of recombination intermediates, resulting in increased chiasmata. Our data provide the first analysis of BLM function in mammalian meiosis and strongly argue that BLM is involved in proper pairing, synapsis, and segregation of homologous chromosomes; however, it is dispensable for the accumulation of recombination intermediates.

Title: Master regulator analysis of paragangliomas carrying SDHx, VHL, or MAML3 genetic alterations.
Abstract: Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) loss and mastermind-like 3 (MAML3) translocation are two clinically important genetic alterations that correlate with increased rates of metastasis in subtypes of human paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma (PPGL) neuroendocrine tumors. Although hypotheses propose that succinate accumulation after SDH loss poisons dioxygenases and activates pseudohypoxia and epigenomic hypermethylation, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms account for oncogenic transcriptional patterns. Additionally, MAML3 translocation has recently been identified as a genetic alteration in PPGL, but is poorly understood. We hypothesize that a key to understanding tumorigenesis driven by these genetic alterations is identification of the transcription factors responsible for the observed oncogenic transcriptional changes.

Gene: RNASEH1, PMID: 35711919
Title: Case Report: Rare Homozygous RNASEH1 Mutations Associated With Adult-Onset Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy and Multiple Mitochondrial DNA Deletions.
Abstract: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance disorders embrace a broad range of clinical syndromes distinguished by the evidence of mtDNA depletion and/or deletions in affected tissues. Among the nuclear genes associated with mtDNA maintenance disorders, RNASEH1 mutations produce a homogeneous phenotype, with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ptosis, limb weakness, cerebellar ataxia, and dysphagia. The encoded enzyme, ribonuclease H1, is involved in mtDNA replication, whose impairment leads to an increase in replication intermediates resulting from mtDNA replication slowdown. Here, we describe two unrelated Italian probands (Patient 1 and Patient 2) affected by chronic PEO, ptosis, and muscle weakness. Cerebellar features and severe dysphagia requiring enteral feeding were observed in one patient. In both cases, muscle biopsy revealed diffuse mitochondrial abnormalities and multiple mtDNA deletions. A targeted next-generation sequencing analysis revealed the homozygous RNASEH1 mutations c.129-3C>G and c.424G>A in patients 1 and 2, respectively. The c.129-3C>G substitution has never been described as disease-related and resulted in the loss of exon 2 in Patient 1 muscle RNASEH1 transcript. Overall, we recommend implementing the use of high-throughput sequencing approaches in the clinical setting to reach genetic diagnosis in case of suspected presentations with impaired mtDNA homeostasis.

Title: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a case-only analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations.
Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare soft tissue sarcomas that typically develop from mesenchymal cells with acquired gain-in-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA oncogenes. These somatic mutations have been well-characterized, but little is known about inherited genetic risk factors. Given evidence that certain susceptibility loci and carcinogens are associated with characteristic mutations in other cancers, we hypothesized that these signature KIT or PDGFRA mutations may be similarly fundamental to understanding gastrointestinal stromal tumor etiology. Therefore, we examined associations between 522 single nucleotide polymorphisms and seven KIT or PDGFRA tumor mutations types. Candidate pathways included dioxin response, toxin metabolism, matrix metalloproteinase production, and immune and inflammatory response.
