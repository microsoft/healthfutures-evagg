Given the full paper (title and abstract followed by the full paper and captions) below, your task is to categorize the paper into "rare disease" or "other". To determine if a paper is related to rare diseases,  consider if it meets the criteria of being a rare disease research paper, which could include:

1. The paper discusses genetic disorders or syndromes, including unique chromosomal abnormalities, that are distinctly uncommon in the general population.
2. Research focuses on diseases with a low incidence or prevalence worldwide, aligning with definitions of rarity by global health organizations and databases.
3. Includes case studies or research that analyze rare clinical presentations, or examines small, specialized patient groups suffering from uncommon diseases.
4. Involves the study of genetic mutations, variants, or dysregulations that are known or suspected to lead to rare diseases, or that enhance our understanding of these conditions.
5. Mentions diseases listed in or recognized by authoritative rare disease registries, databases, or organizations, regardless of whether the rarity of the condition is stated explicitly.
6. Centers on the pathophysiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, or healthcare management specific to rare diseases, including the development of orphan drugs and novel treatments.
7. Contributes to the epidemiology, clinical course, or management outcomes of rare diseases, offering new insights into these lesser-known conditions.
8. Expands knowledge on rare diseases through various research areas, including but not limited to molecular, cellular, or clinical studies, utilizing innovative or interdisciplinary methods.
9. Discusses genetic syndromes that involve uncommon intellectual, developmental, or neurological differences.
10. Examines the impact of genetic variations like CNVs that significantly affect the clinical manifestations or prognosis of rare diseases.
11. Entails genetic analysis within recognized rare disease loci, functional gene studies related to rare diseases, or genomic profiling that clarifies the genetic landscape of rare conditions.
12. Investigates the genetic foundations or mechanistic pathways in rare disorders or unique subsets of more prevalent diseases that exhibit rare characteristics.

Classify the paper as "other" for anything else. Examples include, if it primarily concerns common diseases, broad medical or scientific research not specific to rare diseases, non-disease-specific public health issues, or if rare diseases are not the central focus of the publication.

To appropriately categorize the paper, thoroughly assess the full text, seeking connections to rare diseases. Use a broad and inclusive strategy to identify signs of rare disease research, avoiding overly restrictive criteria that may exclude relevant studies. Your judgment should reflect the research's intent and its potential significance to the rare disease community.

Your output response should only be "rare disease" or "other". 

Your response should be in the following format:
{
  "paper_category": "rare disease" | "other"
}
