Given the full paper (title and abstract followed by the full paper and captions) below, your task is to categorize the paper into "rare disease" or "other". Please follow the definitions below for how to categorize based on the provided criteria.

"Rare disease" criteria: Determine if the paper discusses a rare disease, which may involve a patient, cohort, or context of a rare condition. Look for indications such as "rare disease", "mendelian", "monogenic", "monoallelic", "inherited", "germline mutations", "variants of unknown or uncertain significance", "pathogenic", "benign", "de novo", "autosomal dominant", "autosomal recessive", "compound heterozygous", or "zygosity". The disease might be described as having a rare occurrence or being a rarity. References to the ACMG guidelines or known rare diseases should also be noted. If the paper fits any of these criteria, it should be categorized as "rare disease".

"Other" criteria: If the paper does not fit into "rare disease", it should be labeled as "other".

Use the full text to make your determination of the category ("rare disease" or "other").
