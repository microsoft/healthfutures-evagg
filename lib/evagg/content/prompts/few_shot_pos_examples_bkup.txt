Title: Human RHOH deficiency causes T cell defects and susceptibility to EV-HPV infections.
Abstract: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased susceptibility to specific human papillomaviruses, the betapapillomaviruses. These EV-HPVs cause warts and increase the risk of skin carcinomas in otherwise healthy individuals. Inactivating mutations in epidermodysplasia verruciformis 1 (EVER1) or EVER2 have been identified in most, but not all, patients with autosomal recessive EV. We found that 2 young adult siblings presenting with T cell deficiency and various infectious diseases, including persistent EV-HPV infections, were homozygous for a mutation creating a stop codon in the ras homolog gene family member H (RHOH) gene. RHOH encodes an atypical Rho GTPase expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells. Patients' circulating T cells contained predominantly effector memory T cells, which displayed impaired TCR signaling. Additionally, very few circulating T cells expressed the β7 integrin subunit, which homes T cells to specific tissues. Similarly, Rhoh-null mice exhibited a severe overall T cell defect and abnormally small numbers of circulating β7-positive cells. Expression of the WT, but not of the mutated RHOH, allele in Rhoh-/- hematopoietic stem cells corrected the T cell lymphopenia in mice after bone marrow transplantation. We conclude that RHOH deficiency leads to T cell defects and persistent EV-HPV infections, suggesting that T cells play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic EV-HPV infections.

Title: Novel LRRK2 mutations and other rare, non-BAP1-related candidate tumor predisposition gene variants in high-risk cancer families with mesothelioma and other tumors.
Abstract: There is irrefutable evidence that germline BRCA1-associated protein 1 gene (BAP1) mutations contribute to malignant mesothelioma (MM) susceptibility. However, BAP1 mutations are not found in all cases with evidence of familial MM or in other high-risk cancer families affected by various cancers, including MM. The goal of this study was to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the frequency and types of germline gene variants occurring in 12 MM patients who were selected from a series of 141 asbestos-exposed MM patients with a family history of cancer but without a germline BAP1 mutation. WGS was also performed on two MM cases, a proband and sibling, from a previously reported family with multiple cases of MM without the inheritance of a predisposing BAP1 mutation. Altogether, germline DNA sequencing variants were identified in 21 cancer-related genes in 10 of the 13 probands. Germline indel, splice site and missense mutations and two large deletions were identified. Among the 13 MM index cases, 6 (46%) exhibited one or more predicted pathogenic mutations. Affected genes encode proteins involved in DNA repair (ATM, ATR, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, MLH3, MUTYH, POLE, POLE4, POLQ and XRCC1), chromatin modification (ARID1B, DNMT3A, JARID2 and SETD1B) or other cellular pathways: leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) (two cases) and MSH4. Notably, somatic truncating mutation or deletions of LRRK2 were occasionally found in MMs in The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the expression of LRRK2 was undetectable or downregulated in a majority of primary MMs and MM cell lines we examined, implying that loss of LRRK2 expression is a newly recognized tumor suppressor alteration in MM.

Title: Novel Genetic and Molecular Pathways in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Connective Tissue Disease.
Abstract: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a severe complication of Connective Tissue Disease (CTD), with remarkable morbidity and mortality. However, the molecular and genetic basis of CTD-PAH remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to screen for genetic defects in a cohort of patients with CTD-PAH, using a PAH-specific panel of 35 genes. During recruitment, 79 patients were studied, including 59 Systemic Sclerosis patients (SSc) and 69 females. Disease-associated variants were observed in nine patients: 4 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 4 different genes (TBX4, ABCC8, KCNA5 and GDF2/BMP9) and 5 Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) in 4 genes (ABCC8, NOTCH3, TOPBP1 and CTCFL). One patient with mixed CTD had a frameshift pathogenic variant in TBX4. Two patients with SSc-PAH carried variants in ABCC8. A patient diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE) presented a pathogenic nonsense variant in GDF2/BMP9. Another patient with SSc-PAH presented a pathogenic variant in KCNA5. Four patients with SSc-PAH carried a VUS in NOTCH1, CTCFL, CTCFL and TOPBP1, respectively. These findings suggest that genetic factors may contribute to Pulmonary Vascular Disease (PVD) in CTD patients.

Title: Mutation E169K in junctophilin-2 causes atrial fibrillation due to impaired RyR2 stabilization.
Abstract: This study sought to study the role of junctophilin-2 (JPH2) in atrial fibrillation (AF). JPH2 is believed to have an important role in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) handling and modulation of ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) channels (RyR2). Whereas defective RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release contributes to the pathogenesis of AF, nothing is known about the potential role of JPH2 in atrial arrhythmias. Screening 203 unrelated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients uncovered a novel JPH2 missense mutation (E169K) in 2 patients with juvenile-onset paroxysmal AF (pAF). Pseudoknock-in (PKI) mouse models were generated to determine the molecular defects underlying the development of AF caused by this JPH2 mutation. PKI mice expressing E169K mutant JPH2 exhibited a higher incidence of inducible AF than wild type (WT)-PKI mice, whereas A399S-PKI mice expressing a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked JPH2 mutation not associated with atrial arrhythmias were not significantly different from WT-PKI. E169K-PKI but not A399A-PKI atrial cardiomyocytes showed an increased incidence of abnormal SR Ca(2+) release events. These changes were attributed to reduced binding of E169K-JPH2 to RyR2. Atrial JPH2 levels in WT-JPH2 transgenic, nontransgenic, and JPH2 knockdown mice correlated negatively with the incidence of pacing-induced AF. Ca(2+) spark frequency in atrial myocytes and the open probability of single RyR2 channels from JPH2 knockdown mice was significantly reduced by a small JPH2-mimicking oligopeptide. Moreover, patients with pAF had reduced atrial JPH2 levels per RyR2 channel compared to sinus rhythm patients and an increased frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) release events. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which reduced JPH2-mediated stabilization of RyR2 due to loss-of-function mutation or reduced JPH2/RyR2 ratios can promote SR Ca(2+) leak and atrial arrhythmias, representing a potential novel therapeutic target for AF.
