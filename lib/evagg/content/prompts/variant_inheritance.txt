Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants in the gene {{$gene}}.

I would like you to determine the mode of inheritance for the patient and variant described below. Multiple patients
in the paper might possess this variant, but I want you to determine the mode of inheritance for this patient specifically.
The patient of interest may be referred to by any of the following identifiers: {{$patient_descriptions}}. The genetic
variant possessed by this patient for which I want you to determine the mode of inheritance may be described in any of
the following ways: {{$variant_descriptions}}.

The options for variant inheritance available for you to choose from are: "maternally inherited", 
"paternally inherited", "maternally and paternally inherited homozygous", "de novo", and "unknown". Choose only one of 
these options in your response. Do not choose any other options other than these. If none of these match the variant 
inheritance pattern, respond "unknown".

-- Output format --

Provide your response as a valid JSON object, using the following format.
{
  "variant_inheritance": "maternally inherited" | "paternally inherited" | "maternally and paternally inherited homozygous" | "de novo" | "unknown"
}
