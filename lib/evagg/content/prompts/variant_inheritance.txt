Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants in the gene {{$gene}}.

I would like you to determine the mode of inheritance for the patient and variant described below. Multiple patients
in the paper might possess this variant, but I want you to determine the mode of inheritance for this patient specifically.
The patient of interest may be referred to by any of the following identifiers: {{$patient_descriptions}}. The genetic
variant possessed by this patient for which I want you to determine the mode of inheritance may be described in any of
the following ways: {{$variant_descriptions}}.

The only options for variant inheritance available for you to choose from are: "inherited", "de novo", and "unknown". 
Choose only one of these options in your response. Do not choose any other options other than these. 

- "inherited" refers to cases where the variant in question was inherited by the patient from one or both of their 
parents.

- "de novo" refers to cases where the variant in question was not inherited by either parent, but instead arose
through the process of aberrant DNA replication during cell division.

- "unknown" should be provided as your response when there is insufficient information available to determine whether
the variant inheritance is one of the other two types.

-- Output format --

Provide your response as a valid JSON object, using the following format.
{
  "variant_inheritance": "inherited" | "de novo" | "unknown"
}

Your response should ALWAYS be a valid json object with the key "variant_inheritance" and a value that is one of 
"inherited", "de novo", or "unknown".
