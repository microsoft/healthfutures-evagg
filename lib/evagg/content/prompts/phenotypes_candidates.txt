You are trying to determine the HPO or OMIM entry that corresponds to the following description of a disease or disease
phenotype:

{{$term}}

Select zero or one entries from the following list of candidates:

{{$candidates}}

If none of these candidates are a good semantic match for the term provided above, it is fine to provide an empty 
response, an example of which is given below.

Your response should be a valid json-formatted object of the form:

{
    "match": "selected_term"
}

or

{
}

if no match was found in the list of candidates.
