Below I'm going to provide you a list of phenotypic descriptions. Please respond to me with a list of corresponding
terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology. Don't make terms up, if you cannot find a match in the HPO for one of the
phenotypes provided to you, feel free to just return that phenotype as "unmatched".

Given an input like this:

"Dolicephaly, farsightedness, and a misshaped head."

Your response should be a valid JSON object, formatted as follows:
{
    "matched": ["Dolicephaly (HP:0000268)", "Hypermetropia (HP:0000540)"],
    "unmatched": ["Misshaped head"]
}
