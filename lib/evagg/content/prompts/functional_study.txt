Below you will find some text from a paper describing genetic variants in the gene {{$gene}}.
What are the functional studies described in this paper for the genetic veriant {{$gene}}: {{$variant}}?

Provide your response as a valid JSON object, using the format below. The only valid values you may provide in the list
following "functional_study" are "animal model", "patient cells", "cell line" or "none". If "none" is provided, it 
should be the only thing you list.

It is possible that other functional assessments may be discussed in the paper (e.g., in silico modeling, protein 
function prediction, etc.), however they are not relevant here.

-- Output format --

{
  "grounding": "evidence in support of the functional studies.",
  "functional_study": ["animal model", "patient cells", "cell line", "none"]
}
