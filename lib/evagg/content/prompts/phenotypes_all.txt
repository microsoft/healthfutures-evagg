Extract all of the diseases and disease phenotypes described in the above text.  

Each of the extracted phenotypes and diseases should be relatively short, only a handful of words. However the overall
collection of these extracted phenotypes may contain few or many items, depending on the paper text.

Only extract present/observed clinical phenotypes. Absence of a particular phenotype, or normal state in some way should 
not be returned. Do not include adjectives that describe the severity of a particular phenotype, e.g., instead of "mild 
developmental delay" respond with "developmental delay". 

Do not return phenotypes based on biomarkers or lab tests, e.g., "elevated levels of creatine kinase". Do not return
molecular or cellular phenotypes, e.g., "heterogeneity in cell size".

Your output should be of the form:  
  
{  
  "phenotypes": ["list", "of", "phenotypes", "found", "in", "text"],  
}  
  
or   
  
{  
  "phenotypes": []  
}  
  
if no phenotypes are found.
