Extract all of the diseases and disease phenotypes described in the following text.  

Each of the extracted phenotypes and diseases should be relatively short, only a handful of words. However the overall
collection of these extracted phenotypes may contain few or many items, depending on the paper text.

Only extract present/observed clinical phenotypes. Absence of a particular phenotype, or normal state in some way should 
not be returned.

Your output should be of the form:  
  
{  
  "phenotypes": ["list", "of", "phenotypes", "found", "in", "text"],  
}  
  
or   
  
{  
  "phenotypes": []  
}  
  
if no phenotypes are found.
