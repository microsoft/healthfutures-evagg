Please update the prompt below to capture these rare disease papers (given in {gene: PMID: [titles, abstracts], ...} format) that were misclassified as not being rare disease related. Be careful not to overfit to these particular rare disease papers, as I need a general prompt solution to capture all rare disease related papers with high precision and recall. 

PROMPT: 

{{$prompt}} 

END OF PROMPT.

These rare disease paper titles and abstracts are here:
{{$dict_gene_titles_abstracts}}

Please only provide the updated prompt, with no other text before or after. NEVER remove the title and abstract from the prompt. Do not include "END OF PROMPT" at end of your response. Provide your response in sentence and paragraph format.
