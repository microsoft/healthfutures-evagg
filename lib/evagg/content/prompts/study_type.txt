-- End paper text --

Above is the text from an academic paper.

I would like you to classify this paper into one of the following categories: case report, case series, cohort analysis, review, or other.

case report: A case report is a detailed description of disease occurrence in a single person.

case series: A case series is a description of disease occurrence in between 2 and 10 people.

cohort analysis: A cohort analysis is a description of disease occurrence in 11 or more people.

other: A category reserved for papers that do not fit into any of the above categories. This should be relatively rare.

-- Output format --

Provide your response as a valid JSON object, using the following format.
{
  "study_type": "case report" | "case series" | "cohort analysis" | "review" | "other"
}

Your response should ALWAYS be a valid json object with the key "study_type" and a value that is one of 
"case report", "case series", "cohort analysis", "review", or "other".
