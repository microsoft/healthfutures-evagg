Gene: FBN2, PMID: 11285249
Title: Mutation of the gene encoding fibrillin-2 results in syndactyly in mice.
Abstract: Fibrillins are large, cysteine-rich glycoproteins that form microfibrils and play a central role in elastic fibrillogenesis. Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by FBN1 on chromosome 15q21.1 and FBN2 on chromosome 5q23-q31, are highly similar proteins. The finding of mutations in FBN1 and FBN2 in the autosomal dominant microfibrillopathies Marfan syndrome (MFS) and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), respectively, has highlighted their essential role in the development and homeostasis of elastic fibres. MFS is characterized by cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular abnormalities, and CCA by long, thin, flexed digits, crumpled ears and mild joint contractures. Although mutations arise throughout FBN1, those clustering within exons 24-32 are associated with the most severe form of MFS, so-called neonatal MFS. All the mutations described in CCA occur in the "neonatal region" of FBN2. Both MFS and CCA are thought to arise via a dominant negative mechanism. The analysis of mouse mutations has demonstrated that fibrillin-1 microfibrils are mainly engaged in tissue homeostasis rather than elastic matrix assembly. In the current investigation, we have analysed the classical mouse mutant shaker-with-syndactylism using a positional candidate approach and demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations outside the "neonatal region" of Fbn2 cause syndactyly in mice. These results suggest that phenotypes distinct from CCA may result in man as a consequence of mutations outside the "neonatal region" of FBN2.

Gene: GRXCR2, PMID: 24619944
Title: A frameshift mutation in GRXCR2 causes recessively inherited hearing loss.
Abstract: More than 360 million humans are affected with some degree of hearing loss, either early or later in life. A genetic cause for the disorder is present in a majority of the cases. We mapped a locus (DFNB101) for hearing loss in humans to chromosome 5q in a consanguineous Pakistani family. Exome sequencing revealed an insertion mutation in GRXCR2 as the cause of moderate-to-severe and likely progressive hearing loss in the affected individuals of the family. The frameshift mutation is predicted to affect a conserved, cysteine-rich region of GRXCR2, and to result in an abnormal extension of the C-terminus. Functional studies by cell transfections demonstrated that the mutant protein is unstable and mislocalized relative to wild-type GRXCR2, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. Targeted disruption of Grxcr2 is concurrently reported to cause hearing loss in mice. The structural abnormalities in this animal model suggest a role for GRXCR2 in the development of stereocilia bundles, specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory cells in the cochlea that are critical for sound detection. Our results indicate that GRXCR2 should be considered in differential genetic diagnosis for individuals with early onset, moderate-to-severe and progressive hearing loss.

Gene: ADCY1, PMID: 24482543
Title: Adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) mutations cause recessive hearing impairment in humans and defects in hair cell function and hearing in zebrafish.
Abstract: Cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, which is important for mechanotransduction within the inner ear, is catalyzed by adenylate cyclases (AC). However, knowledge of the role of ACs in hearing is limited. Previously, a novel autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus DFNB44 was mapped to chromosome 7p14.1-q11.22 in a consanguineous family from Pakistan. Through whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples from hearing-impaired family members, a nonsense mutation c.3112C>T (p.Arg1038*) within adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) was identified. This stop-gained mutation segregated with hearing impairment within the family and was not identified in ethnically matched controls or within variant databases. This mutation is predicted to cause the loss of 82 amino acids from the carboxyl tail, including highly conserved residues within the catalytic domain, plus a calmodulin-stimulation defect, both of which are expected to decrease enzymatic efficiency. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation had symmetric, mild-to-moderate mixed hearing impairment. Zebrafish adcy1b morphants had no FM1-43 dye uptake and lacked startle response, indicating hair cell dysfunction and gross hearing impairment. In the mouse, Adcy1 expression was observed throughout inner ear development and maturation. ADCY1 was localized to the cytoplasm of supporting cells and hair cells of the cochlea and vestibule and also to cochlear hair cell nuclei and stereocilia. Ex vivo studies in COS-7 cells suggest that the carboxyl tail of ADCY1 is essential for localization to actin-based microvilli. These results demonstrate that ADCY1 has an evolutionarily conserved role in hearing and that cAMP signaling is important to hair cell function within the inner ear.

Gene: SLFN14, PMID: 30536060
Title: Identification of Two Mutations in PCDHGA4 and SLFN14 Genes in an Atrial Septal Defect Family.
Abstract: Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common acyanotic congenital cardiac disorder associated with genetic mutations. The objective of this study was to identify the genetic factors in a Chinese family with ASD patients by a whole exome sequencing approach. Causative ASD gene mutations were examined in 16 members from a three-generation family, among which 6 individuals were diagnosed as having ASD. One hundred and eighty-three unrelated healthy Chinese were recruited as a normal control group. Peripheral venous blood was collected from every subject for genetic analysis. Exome sequencing was performed in the ASD patients. Potential causal mutations were detected in non-ASD family members and normal controls by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. The results showed that all affected family members carried two novel compound mutations, c.1187delT of PCDHGA4 and c.2557insC of SLFN14, and these two mutations were considered to have synergetic function on ASD. In conclusion, the mutations of c.1187delT of PCDHGA4 and c.2557insC of SLFN14 may be pathogenic factors contributing to the development of ASD.

Title: All three MutL complexes are required for repeat expansion in a human stem cell model of CAG-repeat expansion mediated glutaminase deficiency.
Abstract: The Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) arise from expansion of a disease-specific short tandem repeat (STR). Different REDs differ with respect to the repeat involved, the cells that are most expansion prone and the extent of expansion and whether these diseases share a common expansion mechanism is unclear. To date, expansion has only been studied in a limited number of REDs. Here we report the first studies of the expansion mechanism in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with a form of the glutaminase deficiency disorder known as Global Developmental Delay, Progressive Ataxia, And Elevated Glutamine (GDPAG; OMIM# 618412) caused by the expansion of a CAG-STR in the 5' UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. We show that alleles with as few as ~100 repeats show detectable expansions in culture despite relatively low levels of R-looped formed at this locus. Additionally, using a CRISPR-cas9 knockout approach we show that PMS2 and MLH3, the constituents of MutLα and MutLγ, the 2 mammalian MutL complexes known to be involved in mismatch repair (MMR), are essential for expansion. Furthermore, PMS1, a component of a less well understood MutL complex, MutLβ, is also important, if not essential, for repeat expansion in these cells. Our results provide insights into the factors important for expansion and lend weight to the idea that, despite some differences, many, if not all, REDs likely expand via in very similar ways.

Gene: EMC1, PMID: 36316541
Title: Establishment, characterization and functional testing of two novel ex vivo extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) cell models.
Abstract: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm of uncertain differentiation as classified by the WHO Classification of Tumours 2020. Although often associated with pronlonged survival, EMC has high rates of distant recurrences and disease-associated death. EMCs are translocation sarcomas and harbor in > 90% of the cases an NR4A3 rearrangement. The molecular consequences of the NR4A3 gene fusions are not yet fully elucidated as well-characterized ex vivo cell models for EMC are lacking. Patient-derived ex vivo models are important and essential tools for investigating disease mechanisms associated with diseases that are rare, that exhibit poor prognosis and for the identification of potential novel treatment options. We established two novel EMC ex vivo models (USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2) for functional testing and research purposes. USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2 were established and maintained as sarco-sphere cell models for several months in culture. The cells were molecularly characterized using DNA sequencing and methylation profiling. Both cell models represent their native tumor tissue as confirmed by histomorphology and their molecular profiles, suggesting that native tumor cell function can be recapitulated in the ex vivo models. Using a functional screening approach, novel anti-cancer drug sensitivities including potential synergistic combinations were identified. In conclusion, two novel EMC ex vivo cell models (USZ20-EMC1 and USZ22-EMC2) were successfully established and characterized from native tumor tissues. Both cell models will be useful tools for further investigating disease mechanisms and for answering basic and translational research questions.

Title: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a case-only analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations.
Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare soft tissue sarcomas that typically develop from mesenchymal cells with acquired gain-in-function mutations in KIT or PDGFRA oncogenes. These somatic mutations have been well-characterized, but little is known about inherited genetic risk factors. Given evidence that certain susceptibility loci and carcinogens are associated with characteristic mutations in other cancers, we hypothesized that these signature KIT or PDGFRA mutations may be similarly fundamental to understanding gastrointestinal stromal tumor etiology. Therefore, we examined associations between 522 single nucleotide polymorphisms and seven KIT or PDGFRA tumor mutations types. Candidate pathways included dioxin response, toxin metabolism, matrix metalloproteinase production, and immune and inflammatory response. We estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations between each candidate SNP and tumor mutation type in 279 individuals from a clinical trial of adjuvant imatinib mesylate. We used sequence kernel association tests to look for pathway-level associations. One variant, rs1716 on ITGAE, was significantly associated with KIT exon 11 non-codon 557-8 deletions (odds ratio = 2.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.71-4.78) after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Other noteworthy associations included rs3024498 (IL10) and rs1050783 (F13A1) with PDGFRA mutations, rs2071888 (TAPBP) with wild type tumors and several matrix metalloproteinase SNPs with KIT exon 11 codon 557-558 deletions. Several pathways were strongly associated with somatic mutations in PDGFRA, including defense response (p = 0.005) and negative regulation of immune response (p = 0.01). This exploratory analysis offers novel insights into gastrointestinal stromal tumor etiology and provides a starting point for future studies of genetic and environmental risk factors for the disease.

Gene: TNNC2, PMID: 34502093
Title: Troponin Variants in Congenital Myopathies: How They Affect Skeletal Muscle Mechanics.
Abstract: The troponin complex is a key regulator of muscle contraction. Multiple variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes result in congenital myopathies. TNNC2 has been implicated in a novel congenital myopathy, TNNI2 and TNNT3 in distal arthrogryposis (DA), and TNNT1 and TNNT3 in nemaline myopathy (NEM). Variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes compromise sarcomere function, e.g., by altering the Ca2+ sensitivity of force or by inducing atrophy. Several potential therapeutic strategies are available to counter the effects of variants, such as troponin activators, introduction of wild-type protein through AAV gene therapy, and myosin modulation to improve muscle contraction. The mechanisms underlying the pathophysiological effects of the variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes are incompletely understood. Furthermore, limited knowledge is available on the structure of skeletal troponin. This review focusses on the physiology of slow and fast skeletal troponin and the pathophysiology of reported variants in skeletal troponin encoding genes. A better understanding of the pathophysiological effects of these variants, together with enhanced knowledge regarding the structure of slow and fast skeletal troponin, will direct the development of treatment strategies.
