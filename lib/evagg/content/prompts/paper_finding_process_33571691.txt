To correctly categorize papers into "rare disease" or "other," one would need to follow a systematic approach that involves assessing both the title and abstract for specific cues indicative of a rare disease:

1. **Identify Disease Names and Clinical Features**: Look for the mention of specific diseases or syndromes, particularly those that are not commonly known or are described with qualifying adjectives such as "congenital," "contractural," or "syndrome." In the given title, "congenital contractural arachnodactyly" is a disease name that is not commonly encountered in general medical literature, suggesting a rare condition.

2. **Evaluate Genetic Information**: Papers that discuss biallelic pathogenic variants, genetic mutations, and inheritance patterns often pertain to conditions with lower prevalence, as common diseases typically have more complex polygenic risk factors. The mention of "biallelic pathogenic variants in FBN2" implies a rare genetic disorder.

3. **Assess Descriptions and Case Studies**: The abstract describes a single case study of a 15-year-old girl with a severe form of the condition, which is indicative of a rare or less-studied disease, as larger population studies are more typical for common diseases.

4. **Look for Keywords**: Certain keywords and phrases such as "novel variants," "hypothesize," "autosomal-recessive," "compound heterozygosity," and "nonsense-mediated mRNA decay" are often associated with genetic research, which is a common area of study for rare diseases.

5. **Check for Medical Terms Indicative of Rarity**: Terms like "severe form," "ear deformities," "clubfeet," "muscular hypoplasia," and "tall stature" describe specific phenotypes that, when combined, can suggest a rare syndrome.

6. **Consider Prevalence Information**: While the abstract does not give explicit prevalence data, the detailed description of the disease and the genetic analysis of a single patient suggests a focus on an uncommon condition.

7. **Use External Resources**: If there is uncertainty, one can cross-reference disease names and genetic information with databases like Orphanet, GARD (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center), or OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) to confirm the rarity of the condition mentioned.

Using this process, one can determine that the paper is categorizing under the "rare disease" category. The title and abstract describe a severe form of congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), also known as Beals-Hecht syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in FBN2, and they detail the genetic investigation of a single case, which is indicative of the study of a rare disease.
 It is essential that you provide your response as a single string: "rare disease" or "other" based on your classification. The only valid values in your output response should be "rare disease" or "other".

Below are the title and abstract:

Title: Severe congenital contractural arachnodactyly caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in FBN2.
Abstract: Fibrillin-2, encoded by FBN2, plays an important role in the early process of elastic fiber assembly. To date, heterozygous pathogenic variants in FBN2 have been shown to cause congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA; Beals-Hecht syndrome). Classical CCA is characterized by long and slender fingers and toes, ear deformities, joint contractures at birth, clubfeet, muscular hypoplasia and often tall stature. In individuals with a severe CCA form, different cardiovascular or gastrointestinal anomalies have been described. Here, we report on a 15-year-old girl with a severe form of CCA and novel biallelic variants in FBN2. The girl inherited the missense variant c.3563G > T/p.(Gly1188Val) from her unaffected father and the nonsense variant c.6831C > A/p.(Cys2277*) from her healthy mother. We could detect only a small amount of FBN2 transcripts harboring the nonsense variant in leukocyte-derived mRNA from the patient and mother suggesting nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. As the father did not show any clinical signs of CCA we hypothesize the missense variant c.3563G > T to be a hypomorphic allele. Taken together, our data suggests that severe CCA can be inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner by compound heterozygosity of a hypomorphic and a null allele of the FBN2 gene.
