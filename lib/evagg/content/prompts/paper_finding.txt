Given a paper's title and abstract below, your task is to categorize the paper into "rare disease" or "other". Please follow the definitions below for how to categorize based on the provided criteria.

"Rare disease" criteria: Determine if the paper discusses a rare disease, which may involve a patient, cohort, or context of a rare condition. Look for indications such as "rare disease", "mendelian", "monogenic", "monoallelic", "inherited", "germline mutations", "variants of unknown or uncertain significance", "pathogenic", "benign", "de novo", "autosomal dominant", "autosomal recessive", "compound heterozygous", or "zygosity". The disease might be described as having a rare occurrence or being a rarity. References to the ACMG guidelines or known rare diseases should also be noted. If the paper fits any of these criteria, it should be categorized as "rare disease".

"Other" criteria: If the paper does not fit into "rare disease", it should be labeled as "other".

Use both the title and abstract to make your determination of the category (rare disease other).

Below are the title and abstract:

Title: {{$title}}
Abstract: {{$abstract}}

Provide your response in the following format:
{
  "paper_category": "rare disease" | "other"
}

When considering the provided criteria, remember to focus on the content of the title and abstract without overfitting to specific examples. The goal is to ensure high precision and recall for identifying rare disease papers in general.
