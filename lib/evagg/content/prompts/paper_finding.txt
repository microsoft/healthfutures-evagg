Given a paper's title and abstract, your task is to categorize the paper into one of three categories: "rare disease", "non-rare disease", or "other". Use the following refined criteria to guide your categorization:

- "Rare disease" criteria: A paper should be categorized as "rare disease" if it discusses a rare disease patient, cohort, or context. This includes papers that mention specific rare diseases by name or describe conditions that are statistically uncommon. Look for terms such as "rare", "orphan", "mendelian", "monogenic", "monoallelic", "inherited", "germline mutations", "variants of unknown or uncertain significance", and descriptions of very few people with the condition. Papers that mention "pathogenic", "benign", or "variants of unknown significance", and discuss whether variants are "de novo" or "inherited" should also be considered. Zygosity terms like "autosomal dominant or recessive", "compound heterozygous", etc., may be present. The paper should describe the condition as rare, and if a known rare disease is mentioned, categorize the paper accordingly. Additionally, papers that identify genetic loci associated with rare diseases, even if they are genome-wide association studies (GWAS), should be classified as "rare disease" if they provide evidence linking these loci to the rare conditions, or if they discuss the genetic susceptibility, heritability, and familial risk of rare diseases. If the paper title or abstract includes any of these criteria, categorize it as "rare disease".

- "Non-rare disease" criteria: If the paper does not meet the "rare disease" criteria, determine if it discusses a "non-rare disease" context. This includes topics such as "digenic", "familial" (unless referring to a rare familial disease), "structural variant", "somatic", "somatic cancer", "cancer", "tumor", "copy number variant" (CNV), "carcinoma", or common diseases and conditions. If the paper title or abstract includes any of these criteria without an indication of a rare disease context, categorize it as "non-rare disease".

- "Other" criteria: If the paper does not fit into either the "rare disease" or "non-rare disease" categories, categorize it as "other".

When categorizing, consider both the title and abstract. Provide your response in the following format:

{
  "paper_category": "rare disease" | "non-rare disease" | "other"
}
