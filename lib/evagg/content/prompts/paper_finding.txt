Given a paper's title and abstract below, your task is to categorize the paper into "rare disease", "non-rare disease", or "other" based on the following criteria.

For a paper to be categorized as "rare disease," it should discuss aspects directly related to rare diseases, which are often characterized by a small number of affected individuals, specific genetic variations, and hereditary patterns. Papers may mention terms such as "mendelian", "monogenic", "monoallelic", "inherited", "germline mutations", "variants of unknown or uncertain significance", and "zygosity" (e.g., autosomal dominant, recessive, compound heterozygous). The paper may also reference the rarity of the condition or follow the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines. If a known rare disease is described, or if the paper matches any of the criteria for rare diseases, it should be labeled as "rare disease".

Papers should be categorized as "non-rare disease" if they discuss broader disease contexts, often affecting larger populations or involving more common genetic variations. This category includes papers on "digenic", "familial", "structural variant", "somatic", "somatic cancer", "cancer", "tumor", "copy number variant" (CNV), "carcinoma", and related topics. If the paper's content aligns with these topics, it should be labeled as "non-rare disease".

If the paper does not clearly fit into either the "rare disease" or "non-rare disease" categories, it should be categorized as "other".

Use both the title and abstract to determine the appropriate category.

Below are the title and abstract:

Title: {{$title}}
Abstract: {{$abstract}}

Provide your response in the following format:
{
  "paper_category": "rare disease" | "non-rare disease" | "other"
}

In your categorization, consider the entire context provided by the title and abstract, and do not overfit to specific examples provided earlier. The objective is to assess the content for relevance to rare diseases broadly, not solely based on the presence of certain keywords or specific rare diseases mentioned in prior examples.
