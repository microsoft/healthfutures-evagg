Title: Mutation of the gene encoding fibrillin-2 results in syndactyly in mice.
Abstract: Fibrillins are large, cysteine-rich glycoproteins that form microfibrils and play a central role in elastic fibrillogenesis. Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by FBN1 on chromosome 15q21.1 and FBN2 on chromosome 5q23-q31, are highly similar proteins. The finding of mutations in FBN1 and FBN2 in the autosomal dominant microfibrillopathies Marfan syndrome (MFS) and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), respectively, has highlighted their essential role in the development and homeostasis of elastic fibres. MFS is characterized by cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular abnormalities, and CCA by long, thin, flexed digits, crumpled ears and mild joint contractures. Although mutations arise throughout FBN1, those clustering within exons 24-32 are associated with the most severe form of MFS, so-called neonatal MFS. All the mutations described in CCA occur in the "neonatal region" of FBN2. Both MFS and CCA are thought to arise via a dominant negative mechanism. The analysis of mouse mutations has demonstrated that fibrillin-1 microfibrils are mainly engaged in tissue homeostasis rather than elastic matrix assembly. In the current investigation, we have analysed the classical mouse mutant shaker-with-syndactylism using a positional candidate approach and demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations outside the "neonatal region" of Fbn2 cause syndactyly in mice. These results suggest that phenotypes distinct from CCA may result in man as a consequence of mutations outside the "neonatal region" of FBN2.

Title: A frameshift mutation in GRXCR2 causes recessively inherited hearing loss.
Abstract: More than 360 million humans are affected with some degree of hearing loss, either early or later in life. A genetic cause for the disorder is present in a majority of the cases. We mapped a locus (DFNB101) for hearing loss in humans to chromosome 5q in a consanguineous Pakistani family. Exome sequencing revealed an insertion mutation in GRXCR2 as the cause of moderate-to-severe and likely progressive hearing loss in the affected individuals of the family. The frameshift mutation is predicted to affect a conserved, cysteine-rich region of GRXCR2, and to result in an abnormal extension of the C-terminus. Functional studies by cell transfections demonstrated that the mutant protein is unstable and mislocalized relative to wild-type GRXCR2, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. Targeted disruption of Grxcr2 is concurrently reported to cause hearing loss in mice. The structural abnormalities in this animal model suggest a role for GRXCR2 in the development of stereocilia bundles, specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory cells in the cochlea that are critical for sound detection. Our results indicate that GRXCR2 should be considered in differential genetic diagnosis for individuals with early onset, moderate-to-severe and progressive hearing loss.

Title: Adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) mutations cause recessive hearing impairment in humans and defects in hair cell function and hearing in zebrafish.
Abstract: Cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, which is important for mechanotransduction within the inner ear, is catalyzed by adenylate cyclases (AC). However, knowledge of the role of ACs in hearing is limited. Previously, a novel autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus DFNB44 was mapped to chromosome 7p14.1-q11.22 in a consanguineous family from Pakistan. Through whole-exome sequencing of DNA samples from hearing-impaired family members, a nonsense mutation c.3112C>T (p.Arg1038*) within adenylate cyclase 1 (ADCY1) was identified. This stop-gained mutation segregated with hearing impairment within the family and was not identified in ethnically matched controls or within variant databases. This mutation is predicted to cause the loss of 82 amino acids from the carboxyl tail, including highly conserved residues within the catalytic domain, plus a calmodulin-stimulation defect, both of which are expected to decrease enzymatic efficiency. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation had symmetric, mild-to-moderate mixed hearing impairment. Zebrafish adcy1b morphants had no FM1-43 dye uptake and lacked startle response, indicating hair cell dysfunction and gross hearing impairment. In the mouse, Adcy1 expression was observed throughout inner ear development and maturation. ADCY1 was localized to the cytoplasm of supporting cells and hair cells of the cochlea and vestibule and also to cochlear hair cell nuclei and stereocilia. Ex vivo studies in COS-7 cells suggest that the carboxyl tail of ADCY1 is essential for localization to actin-based microvilli. These results demonstrate that ADCY1 has an evolutionarily conserved role in hearing and that cAMP signaling is important to hair cell function within the inner ear.

Title: Identification of Two Mutations in PCDHGA4 and SLFN14 Genes in an Atrial Septal Defect Family.
Abstract: Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common acyanotic congenital cardiac disorder associated with genetic mutations. The objective of this study was to identify the genetic factors in a Chinese family with ASD patients by a whole exome sequencing approach. Causative ASD gene mutations were examined in 16 members from a three-generation family, among which 6 individuals were diagnosed as having ASD. One hundred and eighty-three unrelated healthy Chinese were recruited as a normal control group. Peripheral venous blood was collected from every subject for genetic analysis. Exome sequencing was performed in the ASD patients. Potential causal mutations were detected in non-ASD family members and normal controls by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. The results showed that all affected family members carried two novel compound mutations, c.1187delT of PCDHGA4 and c.2557insC of SLFN14, and these two mutations were considered to have synergetic function on ASD. In conclusion, the mutations of c.1187delT of PCDHGA4 and c.2557insC of SLFN14 may be pathogenic factors contributing to the development of ASD.
