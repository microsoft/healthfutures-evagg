-- End paper text --

Above is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and potentially the patients or subjects who possessed 
these variants. Provide for me a list of all of the genetic variants associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}} that are
described in this text.

If a transcript identifier (e.g., NM_000123.1 or ENST0001234) or protein identifier (e.g., NP_000123.1 or ENSP0001234) 
is included in the description of the variant, please feel free to include that, but it is not mandatory.

Genetic variants can be described a number of different ways, here are a few examples:
 - "c.1234A>T"
 - "c.1234A > T"
 - "c.A1234T"
 - "NM_000123.1:c.1234A>T"
 - "p.K34T"
 - "p.(K34T)"
 - "chr1:1234567A>T"
 - "p.Ala55Lys"
 - "p.(Ala55Lys)"
 - "NP_000123.1:p.K34T"
 - "A substition of Thymine for Adenosine at base position 1234"
 - "A Threonine in place of Lysine as the 34th amino acid in the resultant protein."
 - "rs123456789"
 - "T65I"
 - "Ser195Gly"
 - "m.1234G>T"
 - "NC_012920.1:m.4321A>G"

They are also commonly found as combinations of any of the above descriptions separated by punctuation and/or 
whitespace, for example:
 - "NM_000123.1:c.1234A>T (p.K412T)"
 - "rs123456789, p.Ala55Lys"
 - "c.1234A>T/p.K412T"

Note that a variant is also often represented with a gene symbol followed by a description of the variant, for example
"BRCA1 (c.123A>T)" or "BRCA1:p.A55T". In these cases, the gene symbol should not be returned, just the variant
description and reference sequence (if included).

The same logical variant can be identified in multiple different ways within the text of a paper - within reason try
not to list the same variant twice, but if it is not obvious that the text is talking about the same variant in two 
different ways, please feel free to list both.

This information can often be found in tables within the text, especially if there is a large number of variants 
described.

If no specific genetic variants are described, or you are uncertain, simply provide "unknown" as your response.

Provide your response as a json object in the following format:
{
    "variants": ["c.1234A>T", "NM_000123.1:c.2345del", "NP_000123.1:p.K34T", "K34T"]
}

or alternatively:
{
    "variants": ["unknown"]
}

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json object.

Remember, you're searching only for variants associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}}, other genes in the same pathway 
may be named very similarly, please be careful. Sometimes the capitalization of {{$gene_symbol}} may vary throughout the
text.
