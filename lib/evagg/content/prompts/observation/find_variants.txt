Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and potentially the human patients or subjects who possessed 
these variants. Provide for me a list of all of the genetic variants associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}} that are
desecribed in this text.

If a transcript identifier (e.g., NM_000123.1 or ENST0001234) or protein identifier (e.g., NP_000123.1 or ENSP0001234) 
is included in the description of the variant, please feel free to include that, but it is not mandatory.

Genetic variants can be described a number of different ways, here are a few examples:
 - "c.1234A>T"
 - "NM_000123.1:c.1234A>T"
 - "p.K34T"
 - "NP_000123.1:p.K34T"
 - "A substition of Thymine for Adenosine at base position 1234"
 - "A Threonine in place of Lysine as the 34th amino acid in the resultant protein."

The same logical variant can be identified in multiple different ways within the text of a paper, within reason try
not to list the same variant twice, but it is not obvious that the text is talking about the same variant in two 
different ways, please feel free to list both.

This information can often be found in tables within the text, especially if there is a large number of variants 
described.

If no specific genetic variants are described, or you are uncertain, simply provide "unknown" as your response.

Provide your response as a json-compatible list, in the following format:
["c.1234A>T", "NM_000123.1:c.2345del", "NP_000123.1:p.K34T"]

or alternatively:
["unknown"]

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json-formatted list.

Remember, you're searching only for variants associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}}, other genes in the same pathway 
may be named very similarly, please be careful.
