Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and potentially the patients or subjects who possessed 
these variants. In order to correctly interpret the variants discussed in this paper, it is helpful to know the
genome build against which the patient's genomes were aligned in order to identifier these variants.

Typically the genome build will be one of the following:
 - hg19
 - hg38
 - GRCh37
 - GRCh38
 - T2T

Some papers will not report the genome build used in which case your response should be "unknown".

If the paper reports variants aligned to a variety of genome builds, your response should be "multiple".

This information will often be found in the methods section of the paper, but may also be found in or near the 
description of the genetic variants themselves.

Provide your response as a json object in the following format:
{
    "genome_build": "GRCh38"
}

or alternatively:
{
    "genome_build": "unknown"
}

or:
{
    "genome_build": "multiple"
}

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json object.
