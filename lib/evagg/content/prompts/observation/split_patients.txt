Sometimes patient identifiers extracted from the biomedical literature bundle together multiple patients.
I am going to provide you a list of patient patient identifiers below. If any of those identifiers refer to multiple
patients, I would like you to split it into a separate elements in your output.

I will provide examples below.

Provide your response as a json object, in the following format:
{"patients": ["Patient 1", "Patient 2"]}

or alternatively just an empty list if you don't see any valid patients in the input:
{"patients": []}

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json object.

Here are some examples:

Input:

"Patients 1 and 2"

Output:

{"patients": ["Patient 1", "Patient 2"]}

Input:

"i.III3"

Output:

{"patients": ["i.III3"]}

Input:

"Subject 3", "Subjects 4 and 5"

Output:

{"patients": ["Subject 3", "Subject 4", "Subject 5"]}

--

Input:

{{$patient_list}}

Output:
