Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and potentially the human patients or subjects who possessed 
these variants. I'm going to give you the identifier for a potential patient that is mentioned in this text. I want
you to tell me whether the patient identifier actually refers to a patient in the text.

Patient identifiers should not be long, they should not be complete sentences, they will generally be something short.
Only report patient identifiers that are formatted similarly to the following examples:
 - "I-1"
 - "II6"
 - "1:IV-8"
 - "patient"
 - "proband"
 - "mother"
 - "father"

Occassionally, patients are identified only by their relationship to each other, e.g., "proband's sister".

Some papers, specifically case reports will be talking about just one patient.

It's better to be picky here and respond with "false" unless you are fairly confident in your assessment that specific
patient is being discussed in the text.

Provide your response as a json object, in the following format:
{
    "is_patient": true
}

or alternatively:
{
    "is_patient": false
}

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json object.

The patient identifier you are checking for in the text below is: {{$patient}}

{{$text}}
