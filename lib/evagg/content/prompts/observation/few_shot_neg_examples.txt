Title: Somatic CAG expansion in Huntington's disease is dependent on the MLH3 endonuclease domain, which can be excluded via splice redirection.
Abstract: Somatic expansion of the CAG repeat tract that causes Huntington's disease (HD) is thought to contribute to the rate of disease pathogenesis. Therefore, factors influencing repeat expansion are potential therapeutic targets. Genes in the DNA mismatch repair pathway are critical drivers of somatic expansion in HD mouse models. Here, we have tested, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, the role of the endonuclease domain of the mismatch repair protein MLH3 in somatic CAG expansion in HD mice and patient cells. A point mutation in the MLH3 endonuclease domain completely eliminated CAG expansion in the brain and peripheral tissues of a HD knock-in mouse model (HttQ111). To test whether the MLH3 endonuclease could be manipulated pharmacologically, we delivered splice switching oligonucleotides in mice to redirect Mlh3 splicing to exclude the endonuclease domain. Splice redirection to an isoform lacking the endonuclease domain was associated with reduced CAG expansion. Finally, CAG expansion in HD patient-derived primary fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by redirecting MLH3 splicing to the endogenous endonuclease domain-lacking isoform. These data indicate the potential of targeting the MLH3 endonuclease domain to slow somatic CAG repeat expansion in HD, a therapeutic strategy that may be applicable across multiple repeat expansion disorders.

Title: Kynurenine 3-Monooxygenase Interacts with Huntingtin at the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane.
Abstract: The flavoprotein kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is localised to the outer mitochondrial membrane and catalyses the synthesis of 3-hydroxykynurenine from L-kynurenine, a key step in the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation. Perturbation of KP metabolism due to inflammation has long been associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD)-which is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. While HTT is primarily localised to the cytoplasm, it also associates with mitochondria, where it may physically interact with KMO. In order to test this hypothesis, we employed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and found that KMO physically interacts with soluble HTT exon 1 protein fragment in living cells. Notably, expansion of the disease-causing polyglutamine tract in HTT leads to the formation of proteinaceous intracellular inclusions that disrupt this interaction with KMO, markedly decreasing BiFC efficiency. Using confocal microscopy and ultrastructural analysis, we determined KMO and HTT localisation within the cell and found that the KMO-HTT interaction is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. These data suggest that KMO may interact with a pool of HTT at the mitochondrial membrane, highlighting a possible physiological role for mitochondrial HTT. The KMO-HTT interaction is abrogated upon polyglutamine expansion, which may indicate a heretofore unrecognized relevance in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

Title: Autozygome-guided exome sequencing in retinal dystrophy patients reveals pathogenetic mutations and novel candidate disease genes.
Abstract: Retinal dystrophy (RD) is a heterogeneous group of hereditary diseases caused by loss of photoreceptor function and contributes significantly to the etiology of blindness globally but especially in the industrialized world. The extreme locus and allelic heterogeneity of these disorders poses a major diagnostic challenge and often impedes the ability to provide a molecular diagnosis that can inform counseling and gene-specific treatment strategies. In a large cohort of nearly 150 RD families, we used genomic approaches in the form of autozygome-guided mutation analysis and exome sequencing to identify the likely causative genetic lesion in the majority of cases. Additionally, our study revealed six novel candidate disease genes (C21orf2, EMC1, KIAA1549, GPR125, ACBD5, and DTHD1), two of which (ACBD5 and DTHD1) were observed in the context of syndromic forms of RD that are described for the first time.

Title: Impaired OTUD7A-dependent Ankyrin regulation mediates neuronal dysfunction in mouse and human models of the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome.
Abstract: Copy number variations (CNVs) are associated with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), and most, including the recurrent 15q13.3 microdeletion disorder, have unknown disease mechanisms. We used a heterozygous 15q13.3 microdeletion mouse model and patient iPSC-derived neurons to reveal developmental defects in neuronal maturation and network activity. To identify the underlying molecular dysfunction, we developed a neuron-specific proximity-labeling proteomics (BioID2) pipeline, combined with patient mutations, to target the 15q13.3 CNV genetic driver OTUD7A. OTUD7A is an emerging independent NDD risk gene with no known function in the brain, but has putative deubiquitinase function. The OTUD7A protein-protein interaction network included synaptic, axonal, and cytoskeletal proteins and was enriched for ASD and epilepsy risk genes (Ank3, Ank2, SPTAN1, SPTBN1). The interactions between OTUD7A and Ankyrin-G (Ank3) and Ankyrin-B (Ank2) were disrupted by an epilepsy-associated OTUD7A L233F variant. Further investigation of Ankyrin-G in mouse and human 15q13.3 microdeletion and OTUD7AL233F/L233F models revealed protein instability, increased polyubiquitination, and decreased levels in the axon initial segment, while structured illumination microscopy identified reduced Ankyrin-G nanodomains in dendritic spines. Functional analysis of human 15q13.3 microdeletion and OTUD7AL233F/L233F models revealed shared and distinct impairments to axonal growth and intrinsic excitability. Importantly, restoring OTUD7A or Ankyrin-G expression in 15q13.3 microdeletion neurons led to a reversal of abnormalities. These data reveal a critical OTUD7A-Ankyrin pathway in neuronal development, which is impaired in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, leading to neuronal dysfunction. Furthermore, our study highlights the utility of targeting CNV genes using cell type-specific proteomics to identify shared and unexplored disease mechanisms across NDDs.
