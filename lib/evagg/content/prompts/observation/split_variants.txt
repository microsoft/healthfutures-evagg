Sometimes HGVS variant descriptions include both c. and p. nomenclature bundled together. I am going to provide you a 
list of HGVS-formatted variant descriptions below. If any of these descriptions include both of these forms, 
I would like you to split it into a separate elements in your output.

One or more reference sequences may be included in a given variant description. Reference sequences are typically
prefixed with NM_, or NP_, but could also be NG_, NC_ or a few others. If a single reference sequence is provided in 
a variant description that includes both c. and p. nomenclature please include that reference sequence in both elements
of your output. If the reference sequence includes both a dna-level reference (e.g., NM_ or NG_) as well as a 
protein-level reference, please associate the dna-level reference with the c. description and the protein-level 
reference with the p. description. 

I will provide examples below.

Provide your response as a json object, in the following format:
{"variants": ["NM_000123.1:c.2345C>G", "NP_000123.1:p.K34T"]}

or alternatively just an empty list if you don't see any valid variants in the input:
{"variants": []}

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json obkect.

Here are some examples:

Input:

"NM_000123.1:c.2345C>G(p.T782G)"

Output:

{"variants": ["NM_000123.1:c.2345C>G", "NM_000123.1:p.T782G"]}

Input:

"p.V123D"

Output:

{"variants": ["p.V123D"]}

Input:

"c.444delA", "NM_000123.1(NP_000456.1):c.135C>G,p.A44*"

Output:

{"variants": ["c.444delA", "NP_000123.1:c.135C>G", "NP_000456.1:p.A44*"]}
