Below is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and a list of variants found in that text. I want you to
filter the list of provided variants by returning only the variants specifically associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}}
in the provided text. 

Your response should be a json-formatted object following the example below that includes only variants drawn from the list
of variants provided. Do not add any additional variants, just filter the provided list by removing variants that are not
associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}}.

Here is the list of variants to filter: 

{{$variants}}

Provide your response as a json object in the following format:
{
    "variants": ["variant 1", "variant 2", "variant 4"]
}

Here is the text from which to determine variant-to-gene associations.

{{$text}}
