-- End paper text --

Above is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and potentially the human patients or subjects who possessed 
these variants. Your task is to provide for me a mapping between a list of the patient identifiers and the variants
that they possess.

The variants listed below should all be associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}}.

Individual patients may possess more than one genetic variant, and individual variants may be possessed by more than one
patient. If a patient appears to possess none of the variants listed, or a variant appears to be possessed by zero of
the patients, I would like you to tell me this as well.

You should output your response as a valid json object, with all of the patient identifiers as keys, and a list of 
variant identifiers as the associated object. You may include an additional key of "unmatched_variants" for any variants
for which you found no associated patient.

Here is an example of what your output should look like:

{
    "patient 1": 
        [
            "c.123A>T", 
            "a substition of A for T at base 123", 
            "p.Ala44Ter"
        ],
    "patient 2": [],
    "unmatched_variants": 
        [
            "c.234del"
        ]
}

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json object.
