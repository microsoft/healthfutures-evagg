Title: Slc38a9 Deficiency Induces Apoptosis and Metabolic Dysregulation and Leads to Premature Death in Zebrafish.
Abstract: Eukaryotic cells control nutritional homeostasis and determine cell metabolic fate through a series of nutrient transporters and metabolic regulation pathways. Lysosomal localized amino acid transporter member 9 of the solute carrier family 38 (SLC38A9) regulates essential amino acids' efflux from lysosomes in an arginine-regulated fashion. To better understand the physiological role of SLC38A9, we first described the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the slc38a9 gene in zebrafish. A quarter of slc38a9-/- mutant embryos developed pericardial edema and died prematurely, while the remaining mutants were viable and grew normally. By profiling the transcriptome of the abnormally developed embryos using RNA-seq, we identified increased apoptosis, dysregulated amino acid metabolism, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis disorders that occurred in slc38a9-/- mutant fish. slc38a9 deficiency increased whole-body free amino acid and lactate levels but reduced glucose and pyruvate levels. The change of glycolysis-related metabolites in viable slc38a9-/- mutant fish was ameliorated. Moreover, loss of slc38a9 resulted in a significant reduction in hypoxia-inducible gene expression and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (Hif1α) protein levels. These results improved our understanding of the physiological functions of SLC38A9 and revealed its indispensable role in embryonic development, metabolic regulation, and stress adaption.

Title: Whole-Exome Sequencing Reveals New Potential Mutations Genes for Primary Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Arising From the Kidney.
Abstract: Low-grade B cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas involving the kidney were extremely rare, genetic alteration or molecular features was not yet explored, which may lead to limited choices for postoperative adjuvant or targeted. Whole-exome sequencing based tumor mutation profiling was performed on the tumor sample from a 77-year-old female presenting with discomfort at the waist was pathologically diagnosed as MALT lymphomas in the right kidney. We identified 101 somatic SNVs, and the majority of the identified SNVs were located in CDS and intronic regions. A total of 190 gain counts of CNVs with a total size of 488,744,073 was also investigated. After filtering with the CGC database, seven predisposing genes (ARID4A, COL2A1, FANCL, ABL2, HSP90AB1, FANCA, and DIS3) were found in renal MALT specimen. Furthermore, we compared somatic variation with known driver genes and validated three mutational driver genes including ACSL3, PHOX2B, and ADCY1. Sanger sequencing of germline DNA revealed the presence of a mutant base T of PHOX2B and a mutant base C of ADCY1 in the sequence, which were discovered for the first time in MALT lymphomas involving the kidney. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumor cells were positive for CD20, CD79a, PAX5, CD21, and CD23, and expression of CD3, CD5, and CD8 were observed in reactive T lymphocytes surrounding tumor cells. These findings illustrated that concurrent aberrant PHOX2B and ADCY1 signaling may be a catastrophic event resulting in disease progression and inhibition of the putative driver mutations may be alternative adjuvant therapy for MALT lymphoma in the kidney which warrants further clinical investigation.

Title: Metabolic Reprogramming in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction in the spinal cord is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the neurometabolic alterations during early stages of the disease remain unknown. Here, we investigated the bioenergetic and proteomic changes in ALS mouse motor neurons and patients' skin fibroblasts. We first observed that SODG93A mice presymptomatic motor neurons display alterations in the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, along with fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. The proteome of presymptomatic ALS mice motor neurons also revealed a peculiar metabolic signature with upregulation of most energy-transducing enzymes, including the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and the ketogenic components HADHA and ACAT2, respectively. Accordingly, FAO inhibition altered cell viability specifically in ALS mice motor neurons, while uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) inhibition recovered cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial network morphology. These findings suggest a novel hypothesis of ALS bioenergetics linking FAO and UCP2. Lastly, we provide a unique set of data comparing the molecular alterations found in human ALS patients' skin fibroblasts and SODG93A mouse motor neurons, revealing conserved changes in protein translation, folding and assembly, tRNA aminoacylation and cell adhesion processes.

Title: Hyaluronidase 1 deficiency decreases bone mineral density in mice.
Abstract: Mucopolysaccharidosis IX is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in HYAL1, an enzyme that degrades hyaluronic acid at acidic pH. This disease causes juvenile arthritis in humans and osteoarthritis in the Hyal1 knockout mouse model. Our past research revealed that HYAL1 is strikingly upregulated (~ 25x) upon differentiation of bone marrow monocytes into osteoclasts. To investigate whether HYAL1 is involved in the differentiation and/or resorption activity of osteoclasts, and in bone remodeling in general, we analyzed several bone parameters in Hyal1 -/- mice and studied the differentiation and activity of their osteoclasts and osteoblasts when differentiated in vitro. These experiments revealed that, upon aging, HYAL1 deficient mice exhibit reduced femur length and a ~ 15% decrease in bone mineral density compared to wild-type mice. We found elevated osteoclast numbers in the femurs of these mice as well as an increase of the bone resorbing activity of Hyal1 -/- osteoclasts. Moreover, we detected decreased mineralization by Hyal1 -/- osteoblasts. Taken together with the observed accumulation of hyaluronic acid in Hyal1 -/- bones, these results support the premise that the catabolism of hyaluronic acid by osteoclasts and osteoblasts is an intrinsic part of bone remodeling.
