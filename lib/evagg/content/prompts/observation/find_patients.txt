Here is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and potentially the human patients or subjects who possessed 
these variants. Provide for me a list of all of the human patients desecribed in this text. This information can often 
be found in tables within the text, especially if there is a large number of patients.

Patient identifiers should not be long, they should not be complete sentences, they will generally be something short 
like "Patient X", "subject 123", "S_xyz", or even initials, like "A.C.". Sometimes, patients are only identified by 
their relationships to each other, e.g., "the proband's mother" or "the older affected child".

Some papers, specifically case reports will be talking about just one patient. In this case, simply provide "patient" as
your response.

If no specific human patients are identified, or you are uncertain, simply provide "unknown" as your response.

Provide your response as a json-formatted list, in the following format:
["patient I.4", "patient II.1"]

or alternatively:
["unknown"]

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json-formatted list.
