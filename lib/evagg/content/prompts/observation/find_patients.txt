Above is some text from a paper describing genetic variants and potentially the human patients or subjects who possessed 
these variants. Provide for me a list of all of the human patients described in this text. This information can often 
be found in tables within the text, especially if there is a large number of patients.

Patient identifiers should not be long, they should not be complete sentences, they will generally be something short.
Only report patient identifiers that are formatted similarly to the following examples:
 - "I-1"
 - "II6"
 - "1:IV-8"
 - "patient"
 - "proband"
 - "mother"
 - "father"

Occassionally, patients are identified only by their relationship to each other, e.g., "proband's sister", this is fine.

In text patients are often described using adjectives, e.g., "proband's affected sister". In these cases, just respond
with a simplified version of the patient, e.g., "sister"

A patient description should only refer to a single individual. For example do not list "proband's parents" as a single
patient. If they are each discussed in the text, then you should respond with both "mother" and "father". Other 
descriptions of groups to look out for are "trio", or "siblings". Those should also not be included in responses, just
the constitutent individuals if they're discussed in the text.

Some papers, specifically case reports will be talking about just one patient. In this case, simply provide "patient" as
your response. In these cases do not add additional text in your response beyond "patient".

If no specific human patients are identified, or you are uncertain, simply provide "unknown" as your response.

It's better to be picky here and respond with "unknown" unless you are fairly confident in your assessment that specific
human patients are being discussed in the text.

Occassionally, strings of digits are used as patient identifiers, e.g., "34" or "75987", but it is often difficult to
differentiate these patient identifiers from other strings of digits within a text, so I specifically do not want you
to return these identifiers. In these cases it is better to omit them (if there are others to report) or report 
"unknown" as the sole patient identifier.

Provide your response as a json object, in the following format:
{
    "patients": ["patient I.4", "patient II.1"]
}

or alternatively:
{
    "patients": ["unknown"]
}

Do not provide any additional text in your response other than the json object.
