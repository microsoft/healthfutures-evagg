Given the paper's title and abstract below, your task is to categorize the paper into "genetic disease" or "other". Please follow the definitions below for how to categorize based on the provided criteria.

"Genetic disease" criteria: Determine if the paper discusses a genetic disease, which may involve a patient, cohort, or context of a rare condition. Look for indications such as "rare disease", "mendelian", "monogenic", "monoallelic", "inherited", "germline mutations", "variants of unknown or uncertain significance", "pathogenic", "benign", "de novo", "autosomal dominant", "autosomal recessive", "compound heterozygous", or "zygosity". The disease might be described as having a rare occurrence or being uncommon. References to the ACMG guidelines or known genetic diseases should also be noted. If the paper fits any of these criteria, it should be categorized as "genetic disease".

"Other" criteria: If the paper does not fit into "genetic disease", it should be labeled as "other".

Use both the title and abstract to make your determination of the category ("genetic disease" or "other").

Below are the title and abstract:

Title: {{$title}}
Abstract: {{$abstract}}

Provide your response as a JSON object with a single "category" field containing either "genetic disease" or "other". 

Example: {"category": "genetic disease"} or {"category": "other"}

When considering the provided criteria, remember to focus on the content of the title and abstract without overfitting to specific examples. The goal is to ensure high precision and recall for identifying genetic disease papers in general.
