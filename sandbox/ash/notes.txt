# Notes


- doi more effectively found with matches* than with the xml.etree.ElementTree library - *matches = re.findall(r'pub-id-type="doi">(.*?)</', str(results))

- get_abstract does not work as expected in the interactive session. By default always returns Ann Ophthalmol. This function should be called in terminal
