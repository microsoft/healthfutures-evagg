TNFRSF1A was first reported in relation to familial periodic fever in 1999 (10199409: McDermott et al. 1999). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 19 unique missense variants have been reported in 20 cases from eight publications (10199409: McDermott et al. 1999; 10902757: Dode et al. 2000; 13130484: Aganna et al. 2003; 16508982: D'Osualdo et al. 2006; 22566169: Jesus et al. 2012; 23322460: Havla et al. 2013; 22343913: Lee et al. 2013; 25888769: Greco et al. 2015). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for probands with other variant type with some evidence of gene impact (7 pts) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of TNFR1 signaling via two opposing pathways that lead to either apoptosis via caspase activation or to cellular survival and inflammation via the activation of NF-κB, functional alteration in patient and non-patient cells demonstrating reduced soluble TNFR1 impaired binding and intracellular signaling downstream of TNFR1, resulting in enhanced production of cytokines and chemokines (17666110: Kimberley et al. 2007; 16684962: Lobito et al. 2006; 20457915: Simon et al. 2010).  In two different knock-in mouse lines with TRAPS-associated variants in TNFRSF1A, TNFR1 accumulated intracellularly and there was enhanced activation of proinflammatory signaling. Heterozygous mice were hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin, which was also observed in TRAPS patient cells (20457915: Simon et al. 2010).

More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for probands with other variant type with some evidence of gene impact (7 pts) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of TNFR1 signaling via two opposing pathways that lead to either apoptosis via caspase activation or to cellular survival and inflammation via the activation of NF-κB, functional alteration in patient and non-patient cells demonstrating reduced soluble TNFR1 impaired binding and intracellular signaling downstream of TNFR1, resulting in enhanced production of cytokines and chemokines (17666110: Kimberley et al. 2007; 16684962: Lobito et al. 2006; 20457915: Simon et al. 2010).  In two different knock-in mouse lines with TRAPS-associated variants in TNFRSF1A, TNFR1 accumulated intracellularly and there was enhanced activation of proinflammatory signaling. Heterozygous mice were hypersensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin, which was also observed in TRAPS patient cells (20457915: Simon et al. 2010).

Variants in this gene have been reported in at least eight indviduals from two publications, including four predicted null and four missense variants (30388402: Schanze et al. 2018; 30315573: Kahrizi et al. 2019). Six of the variants occurred de novo, while one was identified in an affected parent-child pair. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by high expression in developing the brain, particularly in the cortical plate; a shared function as a transcriptional regulator that is shared with members of the same protein family that result in similar, overlapping phenotypes (e.g., NFIX, NFIA); and partial recapitulation of the human phenotype, including macrocephaly and callosal and other brain defects, in conventional and telencephalon-specific knockout mice (15632069: Steele-Perkins et al. 2005; 26021864: Bunt et al. 2015; 30388402: Schanze et al. 2018). In addition, in vitro analyses of patient-identified missense variants demonstrated disrupted transcriptional regulation in a luciferase assay (Schanze et al. 2018). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between NFIB and acquired macrocephaly with impaired intellectual development, autosomal dominant.

FKBP prolyl isomerase 10 protein has peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity (PPIase) that accelerates protein folding, and it may also enable collagen folding by acting as a collagen chaperon. FKBP10 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta with or without joint contractures in 2010 (20362275: Alanay et al. (2010). At least six unique loss-of-function variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least six probands from four publications (20362275: Alanay et al. 2010; 21567934: Shaheen et al. 2011; 20839288: Kelley et al. 2011; 27762305: Xu et al. 2017). Segregation was noted in four families but with insufficient evidence to score. More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and animal models. In summary, FKBP10 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta with or without joint contractures.

Similarly, to some pathogenic TRIO variants, the RAC1 Cys18Tyr variant, associated with a severe clinical phenotype, has an inhibitory effect on AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and consequently suppresses LTP induction in a rat organotypic hippocampal slice culture model (30042656: Tian et al. 2018). Data from animal models also support the gene disease association; zebrafish overexpressing pathogenic RAC1 variants showed altered neuronal proliferation and head size compared to wildtype and conditional forebrain-specific Rac1-knockout mice (homozygous) recapitulate some key features of the disease including impaired neuronal migration, reduced neuronal proliferation and microcephaly (28886345; Reijnders et al. 2017); 19007770; Chen et al. 2009).

NOD2 is a cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor and plays an important role in regulating the innate immune response. The NOD2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Blau syndrome in 2001 (11528384: Miceli-Richard et al. 2001). At least 20 unique missense variants have been reported in clinical cases, with up to 80% of Blau syndrome associated with two recurrent NOD2 variants; p.Arg334Trp and p.Arg334Gln (25182201: Caso et al. 2014). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data.

The BCL11A gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant BCL11A-related intellectual disability in 2016 (27453576: Dias et al. 2016). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique heterozygous variants (three missense, one predicted null, and four predicted premature truncations) identified in eight unrelated probands from four publications (27453576: Dias et al. 2016; 28589569: Yoshida et al. 2017; 28891213: Cai et al. 2017; 28960836: Soblet et al. 2018). All variants occurred de novo. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression in the developing cerebral cortex and hematopoietic cells, functional alteration studies in non-patient cells demonstrating a consistent LOF effect of three missense variants on localization, dimerization, and transcriptional regulatory activity, and a haploinsufficiency mouse model showing microcephaly, narrow skull, behavioral evidence of memory impairment and altered social interactions, and altered transcriptional profiles in the cortex and cerebellum (27453576: Dias et al. 2016). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between BCL11A and autosomal dominant BCL11A-related intellectual disability. Additional reports in humans published three years from the first proposal of the association are needed to reach a definitive classification.",28589569,https://www.clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/3975/gene-disease_validity_standard_operating_procedures_version_7-1.pdf,100029,2020-10-15,2017.0

GATAD2B is a component of the methyl-CpG-binding protein-1 complex, which is involved in the deacetylation of methylated nucleosomes. GATAD2B was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant intellectual disability in 2013 (23033978: de Ligt et al. 2012). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least seven probands in five publications (23033978: de Ligt et al. 2012; 23644463: Willemsen et al. 2013; 28077840: Luo et al. 2017; 30346093: Rabin et al. 2018; 30482549: Ueda et al. 2019).

More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Haploinsufficiency is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is supported by limited animal model data. Pan-neuronal siRNA knockdown (to ~30% of wildtype) of the GATAD2 homolog in drosophila lead to a deficit in habituation, which was used as a measure of intellectual disability (23644463: Willemsen et al. 2013). Knockdown flies also showed evidence of synaptic structure abnormalities in larval neuromuscular junction, implicating a role of the protein in synaptic function. In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between GATAD2B and autosomal dominant intellectual disability. Although the association has been repeated demonstrated in the clinical diagnostic setting, additional experimental evidence is needed to reach a definitive classification.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least seven probands in five publications (23033978: de Ligt et al. 2012; 23644463: Willemsen et al. 2013; 28077840: Luo et al. 2017; 30346093: Rabin et al. 2018; 30482549: Ueda et al. 2019). All cases were heterozygous for predicted loss of function variants, and variants were confirmed or assumed de novo in all cases, although in two cases, the proband’s healthy mother was noted to be low-level mosaic for the variant. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Haploinsufficiency is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is supported by limited animal model data. Pan-neuronal siRNA knockdown (to ~30% of wildtype) of the GATAD2 homolog in drosophila lead to a deficit in habituation, which was used as a measure of intellectual disability (23644463: Willemsen et al. 2013). Knockdown flies also showed evidence of synaptic structure abnormalities in larval neuromuscular junction, implicating a role of the protein in synaptic function. In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between GATAD2B and autosomal dominant intellectual disability. Although the association has been repeated demonstrated in the clinical diagnostic setting, additional experimental evidence is needed to reach a definitive classification.

Knockdown of the MED13L zebrafish ortholog med13b resulted in craniofacial, brain, and eye abnormalities, and the zebrafish phenotype could be rescued by co-expression of human MED13L (25137640: Utami et al. 2014). Suppression of MED13L with shRNA in ES-derived human neural progenitor cells that were differentiated into neurons demonstrated that MED13L regulates transcription of many genes, including those in the Wnt and FGF pathways that are critical for craniofacial and brain development (25137640: Utami et al. 2014). In summary, MED13L is definitively associated with MED13L-related neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.",25137640,https://www.clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/3975/gene-disease_validity_standard_operating_procedures_version_7-1.pdf,100053,2020-10-15,2015.0

It is suggested that the underlying disease mechanism may be  heme overload  (27923065: Chiabrando et al. 2016). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays in patient and non-patient cells (21070897: Rajadhyaksha et al. 2010; 27923065: Chiabrando et al. 2016).

This F-box protein functions as part of a ubiquitin ligase complex and is involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. FBSW11 also participates in the Wnt/β-catenin and Hh signalling pathways, which play critical roles in early embryonic development and tissue patterning. FBXW11 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant FBXW11-related neurodevelopmental, brain, jaw, eye and digital anomalies in 2019 (31402090: Holt et al. 2019). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and expereimental data. Seven unique heterozygous missense variants in this gene have been reported in seven individuals in a single cross-institutional publication (31402090: Holt et al. 2019). All variants occurred de novo. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Structural analyses indicated the variants clustered at the surface of the substrate-binding domain of FBXW11 and were predicted to destabilize the protein and/or its interactions, but the mechansim of disease has not yet been definitively determined. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the gene's role in the Hh and  Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways, in which multiple genes have been linked to similar clinical phenotypes, tissue expression in the clinically affected systems in both humans and zebrafish, and a zebrafish knockdown model that shows eye, jaw, and pectoral fin anomalies that correlate with the phenotypes observed in humans (31402090: Holt et al. 2019). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between FBXW11 and autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental, brain, eye, and digit anomalies. Additional reports in humans published three years from the first proposal of the association are needed to reach a definitive classification.",31402090,https://www.clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/3975/gene-disease_validity_standard_operating_procedures_version_7-1.pdf,100066,2020-10-15,2019.0

This curation included seven unique variants (four frameshift, one stop-gained, one canonical splice, and one missense) identified in seven cases from three publications (19344873: Firth et al. 2009; 27479843: Lelieveld et al. 2016; 28191889: Stessman et al. 2017). No segregation evidence was available, and five of the variants occurred de novo. The mechanism of disease has not yet been clearly established, but haploinsufficiency has been suggested. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a shared function with other genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, expression in the brain in a temporally and spatially regulated manner that correlates with neurogenesis, and a Drosophila knockdown model that shows impaired habituation in a behavioral assay (28191889: Stessman et al. 2017).

Five missense variants in this gene have been reported in a compound heterozygous or homozygous state in four unrelated probands in one publication (29576218: Vögtle et al. 2018). The clinical phenotype was characterized by neurodegeneration in childhood with cerebellar atrophy. The proposed disease mechanism is that biallelic variants in PMPCB cause defects in MPP proteolytic activity and leads to dysregulation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis. The gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function data and functional alteration in yeast and patient cells (25970558: Quiros et al. 2015; 29576218: Vögtle et al. 2018). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.

ATN1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital hypotonia, epilepsy, developmental delay, and digit abnormalities (CHEDDA) in 2019 (30827498: Palmer et al. 2019). At least eight unique variants, including six missense and two in-frame insertions, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and limited experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in eight probands from a single publication (30827498: Palmer et al. 2019). All variants were heterozygous and occurred de novo. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, but additional reports in humans are needed to replicate the initial finding. The mechanism of disease is currently unclear; Palmer et al. (2019) speculate that disruption of the regular spacing of histidines in the HX repeat motif may alter interactions important for the disease process. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. This association will be assessed separately. The association with CHEDDA is supported by limited experimental evidence involving the gene product's function. ATN1 is an atrophin protein family member and a transcriptional corepressor (19043594: Wang et al. 2008). Another atrophin family member, RERE, is associated with a disorder with significant overlap with CHEDDA (27087320: Fregeau et al. 2016), and other genes containing similar histidine repeat motifs, which is the domain affected by all variants reported to date, have also been linked to neurocognitive conditions with congenital anomalies (30827498: Palmer et al. 2019). In addition, ATN1 is regulated by LSD1, which is also associated with a similar clinical phenotype (25519973: Zhang et al. 2014). ATN1 is expressed broadly in multiple organs, including brain, heart, lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle, and expression is higher in fetal tissue, including in neural progenitors (25519973: Zhang et al. 2014). In utero electroporation experiments demonstrate that ATN1 maintains neural progenitor cells in mouse neocortex (25519973: Zhang et al. 2014). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more expertimental evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.

The suggested phenotype name was CHEDDA (congenital hypotonia, epilepsy, developmental delay, digit abnormalities) and patients displayed severe cognitive impairment, hypotonia, a recognizable facial gestalt, and variable congenital anomalies. All patients lacked the progressive symptoms of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) neurodegeneration (OMIM: 125370). DRPLA is caused by heterozygous expanded trinucleotide repeats in ATN1.

The EBP gene was first reported in relation to X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata in 1999 (10391218: Derry et al. 1999).

The spatial and temporal expression pattern of Satb2 in the embryonic mouse and chick broadly correlates with those structures affected in cases with SATB2 associated disorder. Satb2 knockout mice recapitulate key features of the clinical disease: heterozygous Satb2 knockout mice demonstrate the early onset of craniofacial dysmorphologies such as cleft palate and incisor hypodontia and/or adontia, while homozygous mice show an exacerbated phenotype that includes skeletal malformations (16960803: Britanova et al. 2006), indicating the phenotype is dose dependent. A conditional knockout mouse model lacking expression of Satb2 in the cortex and hippocampus also recapitulated behaviour abnormalities associated with the disease (30809123: Zhang et al. 2019). In summary, SATB2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant SATB2 associated disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time.

CTSA was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive galactosialidosis in 1993 (8514852: Shimmoto et al. 1993).

This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data, in vitro functional analyses of reported variants, mouse and zebrafish models, and rescue in the zebrafish model (23868259: Millay et al. 2013; 28681861: Di Gioia et al. 2017).

At least five missense variants have been identified in a heterozygous state in six affected cases (25217960: Romberg et al. 2014; 25217959: Canna et al. 2014; 25385754: Kitamura et al. 2014; 27203668: Volker-Touw et al. 2017; 29778503: Moghaddas et al. 2018). In four affected individuals NLRC4 variants occurred de novo, in two families the NLRC4 variant segregated with disease. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Data examining the impact of pathogenic variants on NLRC4 function, provide evidence for a gain of function mechanism of disease (25217960: Romberg et al. 2014; 25217959: Canna et al. 2014; 25385754: Kitamura et al. 2014). The gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knock-in mouse model which recapitulates the human phenotype (25385754: Kitamura et al. 2014). In summary, NLRC4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant NCRL4 related autoinflammatory syndrome.
Lumping and splitting considerations: OMIM 616115: Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 4; OMIM 616050:Autoinflammation with infantile enterocolitis. According to the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern and the above disorders were ‘lumped’ into the term NLRC4-associated autoinflammatory disease. Duncan and Canna (2018; PMID 29247997) describe the spectrum of NLRC4-associated autoinflammatory diseases and highlight that not all patients with NLRC4 inflammasomopathy develop macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or enterocolitis. All variants described to date in association with this spectrum of disorders have been heterozygous gain-of-function variants, indicating no difference in inheritance pattern or disease mechanism. Although a small number of patients have been described, the possibility of genotype/phenotype correlation based on variant location has been proposed.

This protein interacts with a large number of binding partners that include membrane proteins like receptors and channels as well as intracellular signaling molecules. Through these interactions, filamin A participates in a diverse array of cellular functions, including a key role in cell migration and adhesion. FLNA was first reported in relation to X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia in 1998 (9883725: Fox et al. 1998). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.

In three of these cases the variants occurred de novo. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the expression of Flna in the brain during mouse embryogenesis, particularly in cells involved in neuronal migration as well as in neuronal growth cones (17172441: Feng et al. 2006). This expression pattern, together with the gene function of FLNA, is consistent with the phenotype spectrum associated with disease (21169733: Nakamura et al. 2011).

The AKT3 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome in 2012 (22729224: Riviere et al. 2012).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least five probands in four publications (22729224: Riviere et al. 2012); 23745724: Nakamura et al. 2014); 25523067: Nellist et al. 2015); 28190287: Takagi et al. 2017). In these cases, the variants reported were de novo and variant level evidence suggested a gain in function. More case level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression data showing that AKT3 is the predominant AKT paralog in the brain and a AKT3 knockout mouse model, in which homozygous null mice were observed to have  ~20 % smaller brains than their wildtype litter mates, consistent with a AKT3’s role in regulating brain size (15713641: Easton et al. 2005).

At least two variants, a stop gained variant and a frameshift variant, have been found in a heterozygous state in two individuals from one report in the literature, both with a phenotype of congenital aural atresia and hyposmia (22152683: Feenstra et al. 2011; 24487590: Ragancokova et al. 2014). Temporal and spatial expression of Tshz1 mRNA during development of the middle ear is consistent with the phenotype (17586487: Core et al. 2007). Embryos of the homozygous Tsh2 null mouse model showed a middle ear malformation as well as neonatal lethality, and a conditional nervous system-specific Tshz1 knock out mouse model demonstrated hyposmia (17586487: Core et al. 2007; 24487590: Ragancokova et al. 2014).  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.",24487590,https://clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/2165/gene_curation_sop_version_6_aug_2018_final.pdf,100115,2020-10-15,2014.0

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes limited case-level data and experimental data. Two unique homozygous missense variants in this gene were reported in two unrelated patients who showed repeated fractures, kyphoscoliosis, joint hyperlaxity, and underdeveloped muscles of the lower extremities, resulting in a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type IV (26027498: Mendoza-Londono et al. 2015). Both variants were located in the calcium binding domain responsible for the binding of SPARC to collagen, and skin fibroblasts from both patients showed collagen abnormalities suggestive of a damaging effect of the variants. Neither the heterozygous parents of the patients nor heterozygous mutant mice showed a phenotype. Loss of function has been suggested as the mechanism of disease, but additional evidence is needed. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression data, protein-interaction data, and mouse model data.

PBX1 is specifically involved in body axes patterning and organogenesis (12591246: Schnabel 2003; 18723445: Stankunas et al. 2008). PBX1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant PBX1-related congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract syndrome with or without hearing loss, abnormal ears, or developmental delay in 2017 (28566479: Heidet et al. 2017). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least seven de novo variants, in a heterozygous state, have been found in seven cases with a spectrum of intellectual disability and pleiotropic developmental defects, from three reports in the literature (28566479: Heidet et al. 2017; 29036646: Slavotinek et al. 2017; 29226118: Riedhammer et al. 2017). These included three missense variants, a nonsense variant, two small deletions leading to a frameshift, and a splicing variant. More genetic evidence has been reported in the literature, but the maximum score for this category has been reached (12 pts). Expression data in the mouse and phenotype data from the homozygous null mouse model demonstrated that the Pbx1 protein is expressed in multiple tissues during embryogenesis and is required for the correct patterning and development of multiple organs as well as skeletal development, which is consistent with the clinical spectrum of disease (11566859: Selleri et al. 2001; 18723445: Stankunas et al. 2008; 18849531: Chang et al. 2008).

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. A single recurrent missense variant in this gene has been reported in five unrelated cases from five reports. At least one case was confirmed as de novo inheritance, with another family showing inheritance of the variant in an affected daughter from her affected mother (16685646: Procaccio et al. 2006; 28487785: Conboy et al. 2017; 27862284: Eggink et al. 2017; 28849312: Zech et al. 2017; 29788902: Skogseid et al. 2018).

Lumping and Splitting: According to the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability and disease mechanism. Based on review of a large number of patients, Priolo et al. (2018) (PMID 29897170) conclude that Malan syndrome and Marshall-Smith syndrome should be considered separate disease entities, with important differences for clinical care. However, they note that future data may still provide further evidence for a disease spectrum. The syndromes differ in that Malan results in tall stature while Marshall-Smith results in short stature, with some additional more minor defining features. Some other features do overlap. Rarely, both syndromes may be considered as potentially diagnostic in a single patient. Malan syndrome has been proposed to result from NFIX haploinsufficiency, whereas Marshall-Smith syndrome has been proposed to result through a dominant-negative mechanism. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been proposed. Marshall-Smith variants tend to be scattered throughout exons 6–10 of the NFIX gene, while most point mutations causing Malan syndrome are clustered in exon 2. However, careful functional studies of reported variants are needed to confirm these associations. For these reasons, we have split curations for the disease entities Marshall-Smith syndrome and Malan syndrome.",20673863,https://clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/2165/gene_curation_sop_version_6_aug_2018_final.pdf,100128,2020-10-15,2010.0

(2018) (PMID 29897170) conclude that Malan syndrome and Marshall-Smith syndrome should be considered separate disease entities, with important differences for clinical care. However, they note that future data may still provide further evidence for a disease spectrum. The syndromes differ in that Malan results in tall stature while Marshall-Smith results in short stature, with some additional more minor defining features. Some other features do overlap. Rarely, both syndromes may be considered as potentially diagnostic in a single patient. Malan syndrome has been proposed to result from NFIX haploinsufficiency, whereas Marshall-Smith syndrome has been proposed to result through a dominant-negative mechanism. Genotype-phenotype correlations have been proposed. Marshall-Smith variants tend to be scattered throughout exons 6–10 of the NFIX gene, while most point mutations causing Malan syndrome are clustered in exon 2. However, careful functional studies of reported variants are needed to confirm these associations. For these reasons, we have split curations for the disease entities Marshall-Smith syndrome and Malan syndrome.",24924640,https://clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/2165/gene_curation_sop_version_6_aug_2018_final.pdf,100128,2020-10-15,2015.0

The NFIX gene was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Marshall-Smith syndrome in 2010 (20673863: Malan et al. 2010). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least six probands in two publications (20673863: Malan et al. 2010; 24924640: Schanze et al. 2014). All were heterozygous de novo predicted null variants, which clustered in exons 6-10. Evidence that a protein product is synthesized and escapes nonsense-mediated decay was available for two variants. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, a mouse model, and in vitro functional assays (20673863: Malan et al. 2010; 17353270: Driller et al. 2007). The mechanism of disease has been proposed to involve a dominant-negative mechanism. In summary, NFIX is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Marshall-Smith syndrome.  Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Malan syndrome and this association has been assessed separately.
