These new findings demonstrate that loss of fibrillin-2 results in phenotypes similar to those found in congenital muscular dystrophies and that FBN2 should be considered as a candidate gene for recessive congenital muscular dystrophy. Both in vivo and in vitro evidence associated muscle abnormalities and accumulation of white fat in Fbn2 null mice with abnormally activated BMP signaling. Genetic rescue of reduced muscle mass and accumulation of white fat in Fbn2 null mice was accomplished by deleting a single allele of Bmp7. In contrast to other reports that activated BMP signaling leads to muscle hypertrophy, our findings demonstrate the exquisite sensitivity of BMP signaling to the fibrillin-2 extracellular environment during early postnatal muscle development.

Genetic studies support a role for rare sequence variants in CD susceptibility, and rare sequence variants in the CFH gene have been identified in 8.8% of CD cases. To further explore the role of rare variants in CD, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in 14 affected members of six families and 12 sporadic cases with CD. We detected rare sequence variants in CFH and FBLN5, which previously were shown to harbor rare variants in patients with CD. In addition, we detected heterozygous rare sequence variants in several genes encoding components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including FBLN1, FBLN3/EFEMP1, FBLN5, FBLN6/HMCN1, FBN2, and COL15A1. Two rare pathogenic variants were identified in the COL15A1 gene: one in a sporadic case and another was found to segregate in a family with six affected individuals with CD. In addition, two rare pathogenic variants were identified in the FGL1 gene in three unrelated CD cases. These findings suggest that alterations in the ECM and in the coagulation pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of CD.

This mutation is predicted to cause the loss of 82 amino acids from the carboxyl tail, including highly conserved residues within the catalytic domain, plus a calmodulin-stimulation defect, both of which are expected to decrease enzymatic efficiency. Individuals who are homozygous for this mutation had symmetric, mild-to-moderate mixed hearing impairment. Zebrafish adcy1b morphants had no FM1-43 dye uptake and lacked startle response, indicating hair cell dysfunction and gross hearing impairment. In the mouse, Adcy1 expression was observed throughout inner ear development and maturation. ADCY1 was localized to the cytoplasm of supporting cells and hair cells of the cochlea and vestibule and also to cochlear hair cell nuclei and stereocilia. Ex vivo studies in COS-7 cells suggest that the carboxyl tail of ADCY1 is essential for localization to actin-based microvilli. These results demonstrate that ADCY1 has an evolutionarily conserved role in hearing and that cAMP signaling is important to hair cell function within the inner ear."}}, "IGKC": {"32278584": {"title": "A rare case of selective Ig\u03ba chain deficiency: Biologic and clinical implications.", "abstract": null}, "26853951": {"title": "Immunoglobulin K light chain deficiency: A rare, but probably underestimated, humoral immune defect.", "abstract": "Human immunoglobulin molecules are generated by a pair of identical heavy chains, which identify the immunoglobulin class, and a pair of identical light chains, Kappa or Lambda alternatively, which characterize the immunoglobulin type.

To unveil the cellular function of SLFN14 and the link between SLFN14 and thrombocytopenia, we examined SLFN14 (WT/mutants) in in vitro models. Here, we show that all SLFN14 variants colocalize with ribosomes and mediate rRNA endonucleolytic degradation. Compared to SLFN14 WT, expression of mutants is dramatically reduced as a result of post-translational degradation due to partial misfolding of the protein. Moreover, all SLFN14 variants tend to form oligomers. These findings could explain the dominant negative effect of heterozygous mutation on SLFN14 expression in patients' platelets. Overall, we suggest that SLFN14 could be involved in ribosome degradation during platelet formation and maturation."}, "37041648": {"title": "Novel SLFN14 mutation associated with macrothrombocytopenia in a patient with severe haemorrhagic syndrome.", "abstract": "Platelet-type bleeding disorder 20 (BDPLT20), as known as SLFN14-related thrombocytopenia, is a rare inherited thrombocytopenia (IT).

This patient had a surprisingly mild clinical phenotype, including notable periarticular soft tissue masses, mild short stature, an absence of neurological or visceral involvement, and histological and ultrastructural evidence of a lysosomal storage disease. To determine the molecular basis of mucopolysaccharidosis IX, we analyzed two candidate genes tandemly distributed on human chromosome 3p21.3 and encoding proteins with homology to a sperm protein with hyaluronidase activity. These genes, HYAL1 and HYAL2, encode two distinct lysosomal hyaluronidases with different substrate specificities.

Functional studies by cell transfections demonstrated that the mutant protein is unstable and mislocalized relative to wild-type GRXCR2, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation. Targeted disruption of Grxcr2 is concurrently reported to cause hearing loss in mice. The structural abnormalities in this animal model suggest a role for GRXCR2 in the development of stereocilia bundles, specialized structures on the apical surface of sensory cells in the cochlea that are critical for sound detection. Our results indicate that GRXCR2 should be considered in differential genetic diagnosis for individuals with early onset, moderate-to-severe and progressive hearing loss."}, "28383030": {"title": "Genetic Predisposition to Sporadic Congenital Hearing Loss in a Pediatric Population.", "abstract": "Discriminating between inherited and non-inherited sporadic hearing loss is challenging.

In this study, we analyzed expression of the paralog Grxcr2 in the mouse and evaluated auditory and vestibular function of strains carrying targeted mutations of the gene. Peak expression of Grxcr2 occurs during early postnatal development of the inner ear and GRXCR2 is localized to stereocilia in both the cochlea and in vestibular organs. Homozygous Grxcr2 deletion mutants exhibit significant hearing loss by 3 weeks of age that is associated with developmental defects in stereocilia bundle orientation and organization. Despite these bundle defects, the mechanotransduction apparatus assembles in relatively normal fashion as determined by whole cell electrophysiological evaluation and FM1-43 uptake. Although Grxcr2 mutants do not exhibit overt vestibular dysfunction, evaluation of vestibular evoked potentials revealed subtle defects of the mutants in response to linear accelerations. In addition, reduced Grxcr2 expression in a hypomorphic mutant strain is associated with progressive hearing loss and bundle defects.
