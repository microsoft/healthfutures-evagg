    "input": "CFEOM3 in the absence of additional neurological signs or symptoms (‘isolated CFEOM3’) is a ~90% penetrant autosomal dominant disorder that had previously been mapped to chromosome 16q in pedigrees BN and DP (OMIM#600638, Figure S1A, Table S1A, B) (Doherty et al., 1999; Mackey et al., 2002). The critical region for the CFEOM3 gene was 3.5 Mb and flanked by D16S498-16qter. To identify the CFEOM3 gene, we screened coding exons and intron-exon boundaries of positional candidates in probands from BN, DP, and additional families with isolated CFEOM3. We identified three heterozygous TUBB3 missense changes in 15 unrelated pedigrees: 784C>T (R262C) in 11 pedigrees, 904G>A (A302T) in three pedigrees, and 185G>A (R62Q) in one pedigree (Figure S1B, Table S1B, C, D). We had ascertained study participants with CFEOM and additional neurological symptoms and, given the pan-neuronal expression of TUBB3 in humans (http: //www.hudsen.org, HUDSEN Human Gene Expression Spatial Database, ID: 411), we next sequenced DNA from these probands. We identified five additional heterozygous TUBB3 missense changes in 13 unrelated pedigrees. 1249G>C (D417H) and 1249G>A (D417N) alter the same residue and co-segregate in a dominant fashion in one and four pedigrees, respectively. The remaining mutations, 1138C>T (R380C), 785G>A (R262H), and 1228G>A (E410K), were found in one, two, and six pedigrees, respectively, and each arose de novo as sporadic disease or from presumed germ-line mosaicism (Figure S1B, Table S1A, E). Each of the eight mutations segregated with the TUBB3 phenotype, was absent in parents of sporadic individuals, and was not present on over 1700 control chromosomes. The independent nature of the recurrent mutations is supported by de novo occurrences, ethnic and geographic diversity among probands, and multiple disease-associated haplotypes (Table S1C).",
